IN BURMA</a></h2>

<small>RALPH STARTS UPON HIS VOYAGE</small></h2>


<p>Mrs. Denham sat in her parlour, a two years old baby boy
asleep upon her lap, and an anxious, mournful expression
upon her face. She wore the dress of a widow,&mdash;a dress
so new in its folds that it was evidently but a short time
since the Dread Messenger had paused at her threshold
to bear away its master and bread-winner.</p>

<p>The room was a shabby one; the fire but a handful of
dusty ashes; rain fell without in the dreary street; it was
growing dusk, and a soul-depressing cry of "Want chee-e-ep?
Do ye want chee-e-eps?" arose ever and anon, as the ragged
Irish chip boy wandered up and down.</p>

<p>It was a street of cheap houses in the suburbs of Liverpool,
where the misery of poor gentility is perhaps more without
alloy than in any other town.</p>

<p>But the door burst open, and a bright-faced, rosy, blue-eyed
boy entered, with the freshness of out-of-doors upon
him.</p>

<p>"All alone, mother?" said he. "Where's Agnes?
Where are the little ones? Why, what a scurvy fire you
have! let me cheer it up a little."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>He began piling lumps of coal upon the embers in a
scientific manner, to which a blaze quickly responded; when
he swept up the hearth, and uttered an exclamation of
satisfaction as he bent to kiss his mother's face.</p>

<p>"It requires a man to make up a fire," said he. "Where
are all the others?"</p>

<p>"Agnes is giving the little ones their tea in the kitchen,"
replied Mrs. Denham. "I asked her to keep them out
of the way for a while, because I want to talk to you,
Ralph dear."</p>

<p>"All right, mother mine, fire away," said the boy,
throwing himself down on the hearthrug, and resting one
arm upon her knee.</p>

<p>"Ralph dear," resumed she, "your uncle Sam has come
home; he has been here this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Uncle Sam? How jolly! When did the <i>Pelican</i> come
in, mother? I did not know that she was even off Holyhead."</p>

<p>"The <i>Pelican</i> was docked last night, dear, upon the
evening tide," said she; "and your uncle has been here a
long time this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Was he not very sorry to hear about father?" asked
Ralph in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; but he was prepared for the news by my
last letter. He is a very kind brother; he has been giving
my affairs his careful consideration all the way home, and
has already offered some prospect of help; but this depends
upon you, Ralph."</p>

<p>"Upon <i>me</i>, mother? I would be so proud to help. You
may reckon upon me; but what can I do?"</p>

<p>"What it is a bitter pill for me to swallow, my boy, yet
it would be such a help that I do not know how to refuse
it."</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is for you to go out to Burma, dear. When my last
letter reached him, and he knew of your father's hopeless
state of health, Uncle Sam secured for you the chance of
a situation in a rice firm in Rangoon. He says that there
would be a salary at once, upon which you could live
with care, and which would soon improve into something
much better, and into a position from which, in a few
years, you might help one of your brothers. It is not in
the house of Herford Brothers,&mdash;I wish it were,&mdash;but, as
he sails for them, he will often see you, and bring us home
news of you. It would not be as if you went to quite a
strange place, where you would know nobody; and, Ralph,
it would be an immense relief even to have your keep off
my hands just at present. Dear Agnes maintains herself by
her teaching; Lisa's scholarship provides for her education;
and if you, my darling boy, were not here we might double
up closer and spare another room for a second lodger,
which would be a great help to me. But I do not know how
to part with you, Ralph, my boy,&mdash;my dear, dear boy!"</p>

<p>The poor lady bent her face down upon the curly, tousled
head at her knee, and wept sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Ralph passed his arm round her neck in silence, for
tumultuous emotion choked him, and he could not speak
at first. There had been a time, not so long before, when
he would have been wild with delight at the thought of
leaving school, going abroad, seeing new countries, being
independent. But recent events had sobered his spirits
and made him more thoughtful.</p>

<p>He pondered the scheme now without excitement or
selfish pleasure; he tried to think whether it would be
well for his mother were he to leave her. It seemed to him
that it would be so.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, "it is not as if Agnes were not older
than I. Agnes is seventeen, and a companion to you,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
while I am not old enough to take father's place with
Jack and Reggie. They would not attend to me nor obey
me."</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"Then when father was dying he bade me do my best
to help you, and I promised that I would. If this is the
best for you, mother, I <i>must</i> do it."</p>

<p>There was a manly ring in his voice as he said this,
echoing so plainly the sound of the voice that was gone,
that his mother almost felt as if it were her husband
speaking to her in her son.</p>

<p>They sat silent for a long time, hand clasped in hand;
then the sleeping child awoke, and recalled Mrs. Denham
to her busy life.</p>

<p>"Uncle Sam is coming back to supper, and wants to
talk to you about this," said she.</p>

<p>"I will go out for a walk, to think it all over, if you
don't mind, mother; I will come in again by supper time,"
said the boy.</p>

<p>"Do, dear; it is not a plan that should be carried out in a
hurry," said she. And Ralph took up his cap and went out.</p>

<p>He strolled aimlessly up one street, down another, his
hands in his pockets and eyes fixed on the ground; then,
with sudden determination, he changed his purposeless steps
towards the town, and steadily pursued his road to meet
his uncle.</p>

<p>So rapidly did he walk now, that he reached the lodging
to which Captain Rogers always repaired when on shore
just as he was emerging from the door.</p>

<p>"Halloa, my son!" called out the sailor in Cornish accents,
"whither so fast?"</p>

<p>"I came to meet you, uncle. Mother has been telling
me of your plan for me, and I wanted to talk to you about
it while we could be alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, that's right. Men can settle things between themselves
better than when there is a lot of soft-hearted women
by, to cry over the Lord knows what. You are 'most a
man now, Ralph. How you have grown since I've been away!
How old are you now?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen, uncle. Fifteen and a half."</p>

<p>"Too old to be lopping about at your mother's apron
strings. Old enough to be of some use and good, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Is this plan of use, uncle? Do you really think it
would be good for mother?"</p>

<p>"Well, sonnie, to speak the plain truth I don't see no
other way in which you are half as likely to keep off her
hands. They are full enough, Ralph, without a great hearty
fellow like you to be eating her out of house and home."</p>

<p>"That is so, uncle."</p>

<p>"I think that the Herfords would give you a free voyage
out. I believe that I could work it so that they would.
If they will, you cost her nothing more from this time.
Agnes is a sensible maid, she can look after your mother
better than you can. I will pay her rent for her, and take
Jack to sea with me as soon as he is old enough; and then
with a lodger or two, and the bit of money that she has,
she may do fairly well. Be a man, Ralph, and do your part."</p>

<p>"I will, uncle, God helping me."</p>

<p>"Well said. But now, look here, there must be no
chopping and changing; no crying out that you are homesick,
or don't like it, and want to come back again. If
you make up your mind to go, there must be some expense
incurred for your outfit; and I'll not help unless you give
me your word of honour that this shall be <i>all</i> that you
mean to cost us. If I launch you, you must sail away on
your own account, and make the best of matters however
they may turn out. Do you understand me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, uncle. Is it necessary to give my answer now,
this evening, or may I sleep upon it?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind your sleeping upon it, as you call it, but
I must have your answer almost at once, because I must see
Mr. Herford about your passage, and your kit must be got
ready."</p>

<p>"I will tell you to-morrow, uncle."</p>

<p>"Mind you do. Mr. Herford goes from home at the end
of the week, and I don't know how long he may be away.
It would hurry everything up too closely to wait till he
returns, when all the <i>Pelican's</i> cargo will be in course of
loading, and everything else to settle."</p>

<p>Captain Rogers had intended to make the evening
pleasant to his sister and her young folks, but fate was
too strong for him on that occasion. Mrs. Denham's eyes
were full of tears, and she kept silence as the only way to
prevent their overflow. Agnes was little better, and the
repressed agitation of their elders checked all the younger
ones' chatter.</p>

<p>He went away early; but Ralph would not talk to any
of them even when his uncle had left them. He went to
his room, and spent the night in thinking, thinking, thinking;
trying to make out what his father would have wished,&mdash;what
was best for his mother,&mdash;where his strongest duty
lay.</p>

<p>At last he took to prayer; and, for the first time in his
young life, really sought help and counsel from his Father
in heaven. Such seeking is never unanswered; he slept,
woke up clear in his mind as to what he ought to do, and
told his uncle that he would go.</p>

<p>"You decide rightly," said his uncle. "People cannot
very often do just what they would like best. If I could, I
would have got you a start in life nearer home, so that your
mother might keep you to be a comfort to her; but she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
will not mind so much when you are once gone, and you
will sooner be of real use to her and to your brothers in this
way than in any other which any of us can command. But,
remember, you must take life as it comes, and work hard
for yourself once you are started."</p>

<p>"I will, uncle, God helping me."</p>

<p>"Well said, my boy."</p>

<p>After that, all was hurry to prepare him for this important
change in his life; his mother cried incessantly;
his sister Agnes went about with red eyes, which could
scarcely see the stitches that she set in his clothes; his
uncle drove him about hither and thither; there was no
time to think until the adieux were all made, and they had
been towed out of dock.</p>

<p>The <i>Pelican of the North</i> was a barque-rigged, three-masted
vessel, laden with coal for Moulmein; and the day
was bright when she dropped down the river Mersey. The
crew were in good spirits, for the weather, which had been
extremely dull and wet for some weeks, cleared up suddenly
on the day of sailing. The chilly wind had veered into a
balmy quarter, the drenching rain ceased, the sun broke
out, and all the little tossing waves seemed to be dancing
with joy to see its beams sparkling upon their crests. Great
masses of clouds were driving away, farther and farther,
overhead, losing their heavy grey colour, and fast becoming
soft and snowy white; while the flocks of seagulls,
swooping about upon widespread pinions high in the air,
might be imagined to be fleecy morsels detached from
them on their course, so pure and silvery was their plumage.</p>

<p>Ralph stood by the capstan, looking back to the fort
and lighthouse on the New Brighton Point with mixed
feelings.</p>

<p>He had never been farther away from home than this
before; he was now setting off for an unknown life in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
new country, among strangers, to make his own way as
best he could.</p>

<p>He was pleased with his independence, with the thought
that he was thus helping his mother; but he had not imagined
how love for his home would tug at his heart-strings.
It was not until he had felt his mother's farewell kiss, and
heard her choked voice blessing him for the last time; it
was not until his dearly-loved companion-sister Agnes had
sobbed her good-bye on his shoulder; not till he had put
the pretty baby back into his nurse's arms, and thought
what a great boy he would be before he should, in all probability,
see him again,&mdash;that he realised how far away he
was going, and going alone.</p>

<p>But Ralph owned plenty of pluck; he meant to be
brave, and to get on in his new career, so he gulped down
these thoughts, and turned to brighter considerations.</p>

<p>His uncle had secured for him a free passage out to Rangoon
by entering him as apprentice upon the ship's books.</p>

<p>This is an arrangement occasionally made, by favour, in
merchant ships not registered for carrying passengers. The
so-called apprentice would hold rather an anomalous position,
being expected to do a little light work, particularly while
in port, but messing with the captain at sea.</p>

<p>A hardy lad would have little of which to complain in
the light of the great pecuniary advantage to himself, but
it would depend largely upon his own tact, and also much
upon the characters of the regular apprentices and the
mates, as to whether he were, or were not, thoroughly
comfortable upon a long voyage.</p>

<p>Captain Rogers had another passenger upon this occasion,
a Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>Mr. Augustus Herford, the head of the firm of Herford
Brothers, to which the <i>Pelican of the North</i> belonged, was
devoted to his garden; and orchids were his reigning
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
hobby. The craze for these flowers was then in its infancy,
many varieties being unknown at that time which have
since become common. Burma was comparatively little
explored, nor were its forests and jungles haunted by
collectors as they have been of late years.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist was a self-made man, an enthusiast in his
profession as gardener, but more capable than rich. He
had educated himself, studied at Kew, mastered much of
the science of horticulture,&mdash;but lacked capital, and wanted
to marry. When, therefore, Mr. Augustus Herford offered
him advantageous terms if he would go to Burma and
collect orchids for him, he accepted the commission with
eagerness, knowing well that, if he succeeded, his prosperity
upon his return would be assured.</p>

<p>Mr. Herford was rich; he spared no expense over microscopes,
books, collecting boxes, and all the properties for the
expedition, and gave him a free passage out.</p>

<p>The <i>Pelican of the North</i> was bound for Moulmein with
coal,&mdash;would then go to Rangoon in ballast, and return
laden with rice. She was towed as far as to the floating
lightship; there the steam-tug cast off, and the voyage
was fairly begun.</p>

<p>By that time Mr. Gilchrist was down upon his marrow-bones,
most horribly sick. He was a delicate man, and
suffered terribly. Ralph was also ill, but his uncle encouraged
him to struggle against the malady, and the
other apprentices ridiculed him so unmercifully as a land-lubber,
that he made every effort to keep up, and this with
good effect, for he was soon upon his feet again, with a
furious appetite even for salt junk and fat pork.</p>

<p>Then, in his good-nature, feeling heartily for a fellow-sufferer,
he began to wait upon Mr. Gilchrist, nursing him
and tending him well.</p>

<p>It would have been better for this gentleman had he
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
possessed the same strong reasons for exertion as his young
companion; he would perhaps have suffered less. As it
was, he was ill for nearly a fortnight; and, the weather
being uncertain, Captain Rogers and the mates were glad
to be relieved from the necessity of attending upon him,
having quite enough to do with sailing the ship.</p>

<p>By degrees Mr. Gilchrist recovered; and, grateful for
Ralph's care of him, he then lent him books, talked to
him about them, encouraging him to learn many things
and improve himself.</p>

<p>Captain Rogers was pleased that his nephew should
receive such notice from so clever a man. He had not
much education himself outside of his own business, but
was shrewd, and entertained a great respect for what he
called "book learning."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, Gilchrist," said he one evening,
sitting with his passenger over their coffee,&mdash;"It is very
kind of you to indoctrinate that lad as you are doing. It
has been hard upon him to be cast upon his beam ends so
early in life. His father was a well-read man, and might
have given him good schooling had he lived, but my poor
sister could not afford it when she was left with so many
of them."</p>

<p>"It is an amusement," replied Mr. Gilchrist. "It helps
me to pass the time pleasantly, I assure you. I like the
boy much, he is very intelligent."</p>

<p>"He is a good sort of fellow," said the captain. "I
hope he will get on. But we must be careful not to set
him up too much, so as to make the other apprentices
jealous of him. I have my doubts of that Kirke. I hate
your gentlemen apprentices; they are always more trouble
than profit. That one is not worth his salt."</p>

<p>"Is he a gentleman's son, then?"</p>

<p>"Aye. His father is a friend of my boss; the lad is sent
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to sea because they can do nothing with him at home, but I
wish they had put him in any other ship than this one."</p>

<p>"Is it usual for a gentleman to send his son to sea in the
merchant service?" asked Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"I wish it either were more usual or less," replied the
captain. "I hate having them. It always means stupidity,
idleness or scampishness; and, whichever it may be, they are
no good. If a lad cannot keep his own natural position in
life it does not prevent him from having big ideas of himself
after coming down to another; and if he gets into ugly
scrapes as a gentleman, he will get into uglier ones when
the restraint upon him is less."</p>

<p>"You have much experience in boys and men, Rogers."</p>

<p>"Ah! I have&mdash;with a certain class of boys and men.
Now and then one finds a lad who can work with his hands
when he cannot with his head, and who tries to do his best;
but good seamen need to use their brains as well as other
folks if they are to get on. Such youngsters come to us too
late. Their friends don't send them until they have tried
everything else and failed. The hardships of our life fall
five times as heavily upon them as upon a lad who belongs
to a hardier class and has begun earlier. Kirke is not one
of that sort; I misdoubt me but what there will be trouble
with him before this voyage is over."</p>

<p>"Well, the weather seems to have taken up a better
humour at last. We seem to have got out of that circle of
squalls through which we have been making our way."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the captain. "We are coming in for a
quieter season, if it only lasts. I wish the voyage was over,
though. My wife took up a superstitious notion that we
should have trouble over it. She had a dream or something
which impressed her with that idea; and though I laughed
at her, I cannot forget it altogether. Do you believe in
warnings and presentiments?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose there are few men who could say with truth
that they disbelieve in them entirely, but I have seen so
many come to nought that I do not entertain much faith in
them."</p>

<p>"Ah! well," said the captain, finishing his cup, and rising
to leave the cabin, "I suppose I am an old fool to heed such
things. I don't see where mischief is to crop up unless
through that lad, and he may turn out better than I fear.
Good-night, Mr. Gilchrist."</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Good-night."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<small>A GALE</small></h2>


<p>It was of little use for Captain Rogers to trouble himself in
the hope of avoiding jealousy of Ralph on the part of the
other apprentices, for the feeling was already rife on the part
of Kirke.</p>

<p>That ill-conditioned young man despised everyone on
board for not being men of good family, as he himself
was, though he was more conscious of his good birth than
careful to prove himself a gentleman by his conduct. He
could not see why he should be made to work, and the son
of a merchant's book-keeper, a lad whose mother let lodgings
for her support, should be cockered up in the captain's
cabin, reading and writing at his ease, practically exempt
from hard toil.</p>

<p>Ralph had not enjoyed a tenth part of the educational
advantages which Kirke had thrown away, and was anxious
to improve himself now that a chance of doing so was
presented.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist was teaching him mathematics and French,
lending him books upon botany and natural history,
especially such as treated of the country for which he was
bound, and also a few volumes of history and travels. He
taught him much by conversation upon these subjects; and
Ralph, feeling that he had one foot planted upon the
social ladder, earnestly desiring to rise higher, flung
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
himself enthusiastically into these studies as a means for so
doing. His uncle did not demand much manual labour
from him; he performed that cheerfully, but saw no reason
why, his allotted task being done, he should occupy his own
time in saving Kirke from doing his share of duty.</p>

<p>There was no great good-feeling between these lads; and
Harry Jackson, the third apprentice, was a weak, ordinary
sort of boy, who admired Kirke for his adventitious graces,
and had become completely his tool.</p>

<p>The three boys all slept in part of a deckhouse amidships,
a place divided between the galley and the apprentices'
cabin. The ship being an old one, there were no berths
for the youngsters, who slept in hammocks slung up at night,
and taken down in the morning, rolled up, and stowed
away to make room for their meals and accommodation
through the day.</p>

<p>Ralph breakfasted with the other two apprentices, their
hours being earlier than those of his uncle's cabin. After
this meal, he did what work was expected from him, and
liked to be clean and ready by the time when Mr. Gilchrist
could attend to him in the poop, where chiefly he spent the
remainder of the day.</p>

<p>One morning Ralph awoke suddenly, experiencing a very
disagreeable shock. The time-honoured joke of letting
his hammock down at the head had been played upon him,
and Kirke lay comfortably on his own bed squirting water
all over him.</p>

<p>"Have done, Kirke!" he cried angrily. "How would
you like to be served so?"</p>

<p>"Try it on if you dare," retorted Kirke, aiming a stream
of water right into his face. "I only wish you would try it
on, just once, and you would see. Get up! You must
swab the decks to-day, I did it yesterday."</p>

<p>"Drop that squirt, I tell you!" roared Ralph, as his shirt
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was made dripping wet, and a fresh supply of water was
drawn into the tube from the basin which Kirke held
between his knees.</p>

<p>Kirke's only reply was another jet, which streamed down
Ralph's back.</p>

<p>Ralph sprang upon his tormentor, and a struggle took
place for possession of the squirt. The tin basin was upset
all over the bedclothes, but Denham flung it away and
seized hold of the squirt.</p>

<p>Indignation gave him superior strength, he wrenched
the instrument out of Kirke's hands, and Kirke drove his
clenched fist, straight from his shoulder, into Ralph's face
and hit him in the eye.</p>

<p>Fireworks flashed before his vision, and he proceeded to
revenge himself in a fair fight; but Jackson ran screaming
out of the cabin upon seeing Ralph pitch Kirke out of his
hammock as a preliminary, and called to the mate on the
watch.</p>

<p>"Mr. Denham is fighting Mr. Kirke," cried he, "and has
upset a basin of water all over him in his hammock."</p>

<p>The mate came in.</p>

<p>"Now, my lads," commanded he, "just you understand
that I'll allow no rowdy work of that sort. Shut up at
once, both of you."</p>

<p>It was the voice of authority, and Ralph scorned to tell
tales, so he desisted, pulled a dry shirt out of his chest, and
went on deck as soon as he could.</p>

<p>Being a good-natured lad, his anger had then cooled
down, and he began to swab the deck, thinking that it
would act as a peace-offering to give Kirke the help
voluntarily.</p>

<p>Kirke came out slowly and moodily, but did not begin to
work on his part. He stood with his hands in his pockets,
a sneer conquering the lowering gloom on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad you know your place at last," said he, as
Ralph came near him. "I'll teach you a little more before
I have done with you."</p>

<p>Ralph bit his lip to force down an angry reply. He
did not want to quarrel with anyone, as that might give his
uncle trouble, but it was as much as he could do to keep
silence.</p>

<p>At this moment the captain himself stepped out.</p>

<p>"Ralph!" shouted he. "Have you seen my three-foot
rule? I can't find it."</p>

<p>"I know where it is," replied he. "I'll fetch it."</p>

<p>"What are you swabbing the deck for?" asked his uncle.
"Why are you not doing your own work, Kirke? I'll have
no shirking. Set to at once! Ralph, I want you in my
cabin."</p>

<p>Kirke had no option but to take up the bucket and
begin the menial work which he hated so fiercely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gilchrist is not well," said the captain. "I hope he
is not in for an attack of dysentery, but he is certainly very
poorly. I have persuaded him to lie still, and I wish you
would put yourself tidy and come and attend to him. Go
to the storehouse and get out some brandy for him. Here
are the keys. I am wanted on deck to see about twenty
things all at once."</p>

<p>Ralph hastened to obey. The ship was victualled upon
teetotal principles, but a little spirit was kept for cases of
emergency or illness. None had been used hitherto upon
this voyage, and the decanters were empty.</p>

<p>Ralph opened the locker where the bottles were stored,
took out some brandy, filled one of the little decanters
which stood in a silver case, and hurried with it to the
invalid's cabin, leaving everything open in the storeroom,
for the moment, from his haste to relieve his friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist was very unwell indeed. He said that he
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
was subject to these attacks at times; he did not believe
that this was dysentery, he had taken a chill and should be
better soon.</p>

<p>Ralph procured some hot water and prepared the cordial
for him, but he was sick at once after taking it; he shivered
violently, his teeth chattering in his head. This frightened
his young nurse very much, for they were now in latitudes
where the heat was great; no doctor was on board, and he
knew little about illness.</p>

<p>However, the patient was better after a time, the sickness
ceased, the headache was lessened, a gentle perspiration
broke out, and he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Ralph ventured to steal softly away, and went to lock
up the spirit bottles in the storeroom. There he found, to
his surprise, that not only the one which he had opened
was quite empty, but one of brandy and one of rum were
missing.</p>

<p>He called his uncle, who, holding strong opinions upon
the subject of temperance, was very angry. He made a
strict investigation into the matter, but failed to discover
the culprit. The bottles were gone&mdash;vanished; nobody
would confess to knowing anything about them.</p>

<p>Captain Rogers was very uneasy in his secret mind, for
appearances were against Ralph. No one else had been
trusted with the keys, and the spirit could not have gone
without hands. He knew very little personally about his
nephew, being so much at sea himself. He only saw him
at long intervals, and in the presence of others; he seemed
a steady boy then, and Rogers liked him, but this was the
first chance he had met with upon which he could have
gone wrong, in this manner, to his uncle's knowledge.
With this doubt about him, the captain spoke very sharply
to Ralph as to his carelessness in leaving the locker
open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist took Ralph's part. He said that he must
have smelt the liquor upon the boy's breath had he drunk
it, but the captain knew that about Ralph's family history
which he did not choose to talk about.</p>

<p>Ralph called himself a strict teetotaler, which the captain
was not; but the elder Denham had been a drunkard, and
had died from the consequence of his excesses. Had the
madness broken out in his son? Did he inherit it in his
blood? Had it taken that worst of all forms&mdash;secret drinking?
He knew what his sister had suffered from her husband's
conduct; was the same thing to begin all over again in the
person of her son?</p>

<p>For two days the captain was miserable from this
unspoken fear. Ralph had all the appearance of truth
and honesty; Mr. Gilchrist was strongly in favour of his
innocence; but the mate remarked that nobody but Mr.
Denham had been trusted with the keys of the locker, not
even the cook or the cook's mate, who, between them,
discharged the functions of steward.</p>

<p>For two wretched, suspicious, anxious days did this doubt
cark at the captain's heart. Then was little Harry Jackson
found drunk&mdash;drunk as a lord&mdash;late one evening when off
his watch.</p>

<p>Fresh investigations were set on foot, and it appeared
that Kirke had given the boy some liquor as a bribe for
silence regarding his own potations, of which Jackson could
not fail to know as they shared the same cabin. Denham
had not slept there since Mr. Gilchrist's illness, for he was
still unwell, though better; and Ralph had begged to be
allowed a bed upon the floor of his cabin, so as to attend
upon him if necessary through the night.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of his absence, Kirke had been enjoying
himself, after his own fashion, with the stolen spirits,
and inducing Harry to join him so as to ensure his silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The elder lad's head could already stand copious libations,
but that of the younger one could not, and the very means
adopted to secure safety led to detection.</p>

<p>The captain, deeply annoyed with himself for suspecting
his own nephew, highly wrathful for the trouble thus caused
to him, punished Kirke all the more severely, to give him,
as he said, "a lesson which he would not forget in a hurry."
Ralph tried to beg him off, but his uncle was in a rage
and refused to listen to him.</p>

<p>Kirke might have had all the blood of all the Howards
running in his veins so great was his anger at his punishment,
and he vowed to himself to abscond from the ship
as soon as it touched shore, nor ever to run the risk of such
ignominy again.</p>

<p>Things were very uncomfortable after this event for
Denham. His annoyance while it was pending had been
great, it had made him positively unhappy. He felt himself
to blame for carelessness in leaving the locker open; he
was indignant that the real culprit should cast the onus
upon him, knowing him to be perfectly innocent; and he
thought that his uncle should have trusted him better.
At least he should have spared his own nephew from the
charge of dishonesty.</p>

<p>He could not be as friendly as before with either Kirke
or Jackson, and felt very lonely.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist continued to be very unwell, unable to talk
to him as usual. He had to pursue his studies without
help; difficulties beset him; and the other apprentices
made themselves extremely disagreeable, keeping up a
constant system of petty persecution which rendered life in
their cabin almost unendurable, yet of which he scorned to
complain to the captain, each separate annoyance being so
trivial.</p>

<p>Besides this, the wind increased in strength, and so severe
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
a gale from the westward set in that the <i>Pelican</i> had to
scud before it under bare poles.</p>

<p>For two days there was cause for considerable anxiety,
then the mercury rose, a calm clear night succeeded, followed
by a bright sunny morning.</p>

<p>"I hope the gale is over," said Ralph, coming into the
deckhouse and greeting the other lads cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I daresay you do," growled Kirke. "Counter-jumpers
and land-lubbers funk a capful of wind mightily."</p>

<p>"I think we have had rather more than a capful these
last two days," replied Ralph, ignoring the insulting
language.</p>

<p>"You manage to shirk all the trouble it causes, anyway.
I don't see that you need complain," said Kirke with a
sneer.</p>

<p>Ralph was silent. He finished his breakfast quickly
and went out.</p>

<p>The men were letting all the reefs out of the topsails,
and getting the top-gallant yards across, in hopes of a fine
day in which to make the most of the favourable gale.</p>

<p>It was a bright, bustling scene, and Ralph was amused
by looking on.</p>

<p>The old carpenter stood by him. This man and the
sailmaker both came from the same country village in
Cornwall where Captain Rogers and Ralph's mother had
been born. They always sailed with the captain, if possible,
from clannish attachment to him; and loved a chat with
Ralph from the same feeling.</p>

<p>"Nice day, Wills," said the boy.</p>

<p>"'Ees, zur, but it won't last," said the carpenter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Lamb's wool skies, and filley's tails,<br /></span>
<span class="i05">Make lofty ships carry low sails,'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and he pointed to the drifting clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is it, is it?" said Ralph. "Are we not having
rather a bad voyage, Wills? Do ships always have so much
bad weather as we are meeting with?"</p>

<p>"No, zur, but uz sailed on a Vriday."</p>

<p>"What could that have to do with it, Wills? Why
should that bring bad luck?"</p>

<p>"Can't zay, zur, but it du."</p>

<p>"You Cornishmen are always superstitious, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Doan't knaw, your honour, as we'm more so than others.
'Tis no use to fly in the face of Providence ef He've given
we the gumption to zee more'n other volks."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the Flying Dutchman in these latitudes,
Wills?"</p>

<p>"No, zur, I can't zay as I have zeed 'un, but 'tain't given
to every chield to do so. I've zeed Jack Harry's Lights,
though, and we wor wrecked then, too."</p>

<p>"Where was that?" asked Ralph with interest.</p>

<p>"Close to home, it wor. We heerd the bells of the old
church-tower a-calling the volks to evening service all the
time we was clinging to the maintop, and the gear flying in
ribbons about our faces, a-lashing uz like whips, and all of
uz as worn't fast tied to the mast swept away by the sea
that awful Sunday night. Jim Pascoe wor lashed aside of
me, and 'Sam,' zays he, 'I wonder whether my old mawther
be a-praying for me at this minute, up to church.' It didn't
save he even ef she wor, for a big sea rose up, and came
thundering down on uz, and he got the full heft of it right
upon him, so that it beat the last spunk of life out of him
then and there. There wor but six of uz, out of twenty-one,
brought ashore that time alive; and there wor but life,
and that wor all, among some of we."</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" cried Ralph. "What did you think
about while you stood there all that time?"</p>

<p>"I doan't knaw as I did think much, at all. Zemmed as
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ef all thought wor beat out of uz. But they there seamen
as wor drownded then answer to their names still on a
stormy night when the wind blows strong from the west
upon thiccee rocks."</p>

<p>"Answer to their names?"</p>

<p>"Ay. You may hear the roll called out, and they men
answer 'Here' as plain as you can wish, at midnight, in the
heft of a storm."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that? Did you ever hear it,
Wills?"</p>

<p>"Well I can't zay as ever I actually heerd 'un call them,
but I knaws they as has; and why for no', Maister Ralph.
Perhaps 'ee'll believe I, and find that I speak truth, when I
tell 'ee this voyage is doomed to be unfortunate because we
set sail on a Vriday. I telled captain it would be, but he
wouldn't wait for Sunday though I did beg and pray 'un
to do so."</p>

<p>"I can't see what difference two days could make. It
would not have saved us the weather we had two days
since, nor will it make any difference in whatever may come
two days hence."</p>

<p>"Theer's a-many things as 'ee be too young to onnerstand
yet, Maister Denham."</p>

<p>"But 'ee did ought to pay heed to 'un, maister," put in
Osborn, "because 'ee be Cornish the same as we."</p>

<p>"I have never been in Cornwall, though, Osborn."</p>

<p>"No, I du knaw thiccee, more's the pity," replied the
man. "But uz du mind your ma, when hur wor a mighty
pretty little maid, a-dancing and a-singing about 'long shore,
and a-chattering so gay. Uz du all come from the same
place, zur, and we'm proud to knaw 'ee, and to have 'ee on
board, ef it be but for the trip. 'Tis one and all to home,
'ee knaweth, zur."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Ralph. "I am proud enough of my
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Cornish blood, and would like to know more of the good
old county, though I fear it will be long before I shall
have the chance. You know I am going to Rangoon, to
push my way and try to help my mother. She does not
dance nor sing much in these days. She has a lot of
trouble."</p>

<p>"So we've heerd, zur. Poor little Miss Amy, we be
main sorry to think of it. Ef Wills or me can ever be of
any service to 'ee, zur, 'ee must look out for uz when the
<i>Pelican</i> comes to Rangoon. We shall always stick to cap'n,
zur, as we've done for many a day. Uz b'ain't likely to
leave 'un to be sarved by any old trade picked up out of
the slums."</p>

<p>"That is well; and if I can help either of you at any
time, you may depend upon me. It is a bargain between
us," said Ralph, laughing.</p>

<p>The appearance of fine weather was delusive, for the
bright sunshine changed within a few hours to fog and
rain. The wind sprang up again, and the captain was
forced to order the mainsail to be hauled in, the topsails
close reefed, and the top-gallant yards struck.</p>

<p>The mercury fell, the gale increased in force, and the sea
ran extremely high. There was a sharp frost in the night,
with snow, and the storm was as furious as ever next
morning.</p>

<p>The hatches had to be battened down, and it was dreadful
for Mr. Gilchrist and Ralph, wholly inexperienced in
nautical matters, unable to see or understand what was
going on, or what degree of danger there was, to hear the
raging of the elements, while they were in the dark with
nothing to distract their thoughts.</p>

<p>There they were, Mr. Gilchrist in his berth, coughing
incessantly, and Ralph sitting beside him, listening to
the tramp of hurried feet and the shouting voices overhead.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
The great sea would strike the poor labouring vessel with a
force that caused it to shudder in every straining timber;
it would seem to be tossed on high, and then plunge into
fathomless deeps, as if sinking to the very bottom of the
sea. Tons of water came, ever and anon, rushing overhead.
Did this mean that their last hour had arrived?
Were they to be drowned in this awful darkness, like
rats in a hole? Were they never to see God's light of
day again, or look once more over the fair expanse of sea
and sky?</p>

<p>They grasped each other's hands at these times, for
touch was the only comfort which companionship could
give. They could not talk,&mdash;awe paralysed speech.</p>

<p>Then the volumes of water seemed to drain off in descending
streams through the scupper-holes, and voices
would be heard again, and a few sentences of prayer would
break from Mr. Gilchrist's lips.</p>

<p>This lasted for two days, awful days for these poor
prisoners; but the wind was in their favour, and blew them
on their way, though a little too far southwards, and it
moderated in course of time.</p>

<p>The captain had the dead-lights removed, the hatches
raised, and came down to see how his passengers had
fared.</p>

<p>"I never could have believed that light and air would be
so welcome," said Ralph; "and it is but a Scotch mist yet,
no pleasant sunshine."</p>

<p>"No," replied the captain, "but you will soon have
enough of sunshine now. Perhaps you may even have too
much of it one of these days. We have lost poor little
Jackson," continued he, turning to Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"What! the boy apprentice?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Ay, poor child! Washed overboard in the night, and
one of the seamen yesterday morning. We could not help
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
either of them, the sea was running so high. Would you
like to come up for a bit and see the waves for yourself
now?"</p>

<p>But Mr. Gilchrist declined. He dreaded bringing on
one of his paroxysms of cough more than the closeness and
confinement of the cabin; but Ralph, shocked by his uncle's
announcement, was eager to go on deck.</p>

<p>He was not used to death, and it was very awful to him
to think that, while he sat in comparative safety below, yet
fearing for his own death every moment, this boy, so much
younger than himself, had passed suddenly through a watery
grave to the portals of that unknown world where he must
meet his God.</p>

<p>Where was he now? What could he be doing? He
seemed as unfit for a spiritual life as anyone whom Ralph
had ever met. A mere troublesome naughty boy, of the
most ordinary type; rough, dirty, hungry,&mdash;a boy who
could laugh at a coarse joke, use bad words, shirk his work
whenever he had the chance, and who did nothing except
idle play in his leisure time.</p>

<p>What could he be doing among white-robed angels,
among the spirits of good men made perfect, among
cherubim and seraphim, with their pure eyes, around the
Father's throne? Yet had God taken him.</p>

<p>The mysteries of life and death came home, in a vivid
light, to Ralph's soul, as he stood holding on to a rope,
and gazing down on that boiling sea, whence he dreaded,
every moment, to see his young companion's white face
looking up at him.</p>

<p>Kirke came by, and Denham's good heart prompted him
to turn round and offer him his hand. Little Jackson had
run after Kirke like a dog, admired, followed, idolised him,
and Ralph thought he must be as much impressed as
himself by this awful event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>So he put out his hand, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Kirke, I am so sorry to hear about Jackson!"</p>

<p>"Bother you and your sorrow! I wish it had been you,"
replied Kirke rudely.</p>

<p>Ralph turned away in silence. He, too, almost wished
it had been himself, not that he felt more fit to go, but that
the heartlessness of this fellow struck a chill to his heart.</p>

<p class="pmb3">But Kirke was not so heedless of the event as he tried to
seem, nor so wholly ungrateful for Ralph's sympathy as he
chose to appear. This was the first blow which had struck
home to him, and in his pride and sullen humour he was
trying to resist its softening influence. Not for the world
would he have displayed any better feeling at that time,
though it was not altogether absent from his heart.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<small>FIRE AT SEA</small></h2>


<p>After this painful episode was over, amidst a succession
of calms, varied by light south-west breezes, changing
gradually more and more to the east, the <i>Pelican of the
North</i> crossed the line, and proceeded upon her way in
pleasant weather.</p>

<p>Ralph would have enjoyed this time much but for the
pest of cockroaches which now swarmed over them and
their belongings. These disgusting insects were of two
sorts, one of which had always been troublesome from the
first, but were now supplemented by a second, not seen
much except by night, but which crawled about then in
such immense numbers, through the hours of darkness, as
to do great damage. They ran over the cabin floors, up the
walls, were shaken out in showers from the rigging when a
sail was unfurled; they honeycombed the biscuit, they were
found in the boots and shoes, and made life a burden to
young Denham, who entertained a particular aversion to
creeping insects.</p>

<p>"How I wish we could find anything which would rid
us of these beastly things?" sighed he one day to Mr.
Gilchrist, when the vermin had been seized with a literary
fureur, and eaten out the ink from some notes which he
had been at considerable pains to compile from a book of
natural history. "Last night I thought we must have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
some spiritualist on board, or ghosts, or something uncanny.
I was wakened up by the noise as if everything in the cabin
had taken to dancing about in a frolic, till I discovered it
was nothing but thousands of these horrid creatures crawling
and rustling about. Some nights I verily believe that they
will eat us up bodily."</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist laughed.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said he, "we shall be in cooler latitudes
soon, and they will become more torpid, and go back to
their holes again. We are nearing the Cape."</p>

<p>"Shall we touch at the Cape? Shall we see the Table
Mountain, sir, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I rather fancy not. From what the captain said the
other day, I believe that there are currents there which
are apt to be trying to a heavily-laden ship such as ours.
Squalls are very prevalent in rounding the Cape, and I
think he will give it a wide berth. We do not need water,
nor have we any particular reason for delaying the voyage
by putting in at Cape Town."</p>

<p>"We must be near land, I should think, for there are so
many birds about now. Some of them are birds that I
never saw before."</p>

<p>"Albatrosses to wit? You do not want to shoot one, do
you, and share the fate of the Ancient Mariner?"</p>

<p>"No, not quite that, though if everyone who had done
so were to be exposed to a similar fate there would be
a good many phantom ships careering about the high-seas.
Lots of the ships that come into Liverpool have
their skins, or their bills, or something on board. I have
an albatross' bill at home that a sailor gave me. I
have a lot of things fastened up about the walls of
my room. It is easy to get foreign curiosities in Liverpool,
but I left all mine as a legacy to my sister
Agnes, and promised to look out for more when I got
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to Rangoon, and met with any chance of sending them
home to her."</p>

<p>"It will be a good plan. If you have any ready in
time I will take them back for you, and call to see your
mother to tell her how you are getting on, what sort of
lodgings you have, and all about you."</p>

<p>"That will be very kind, sir. In that case I will try to
shoot one of those birds, for they are quite new to me.
They are of a blue colour in part, with a black streak across
the top of the wings."</p>

<p>"Those are blue petrels, I believe; birds which are only
found in southern seas. We will try to preserve the skins
of one or two with carbolic powder, though I fear that
your friends the cockroaches will get at them."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Don't call them my friends! You should have
seen the third mate, Mr. Kershaw, teasing the cook
yesterday. Cook came up in the evening for a breath of
air, and was leaning over the side looking down at the
'sea on fire' as they call it&mdash;it was splendid late last
night. Mr. Kershaw came up to him and looked at him
very earnestly, first on one side and then on the other, as if
he saw something queer about him. Cook began to squirm
about uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"'What is it, Mr. Kershaw?' asked he. 'Is there anything
wrong about me?'</p>

<p>"'Oh no, my good fellow, no,' said the mate. 'It only
struck me that cockroaches are a peculiar kind of pets,
but it is every man's own business if he chooses to let them
sleep in the folds of his shirt. Do you always keep them
there?'</p>

<p>"'Where, where?' called out the cook, all in a hurry.
'Cockroaches on my shirt? Where?'</p>

<p>"He was trying to see over his shoulder in an impossible
kind of way; he put his hands up to his neck and down to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
his waist at the back; he shuddered, and shook himself,
but could not find them; and it was not likely that he
could, for there were none there to be found.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kershaw was pretending to help him, poking at him
up and down his back.</p>

<p>"'Oh, I thought I had them then!&mdash;there, under your arm,&mdash;no,
down your leg. Dear me! how very active they are.
What remarkably fine specimens! They seem to be quite
tame; how much you must know about them to live with
them like this, quite in the style of a happy family. They
really seem to love you. I should not like to keep them
about myself though, in this manner. Do you <i>always</i> have
them upon your own person, my friend?'</p>

<p>"At last the cook twigged the joke, for we were all
laughing so, but he was quite cross about it, and flung
away muttering something about fools, and wishing to
knock Mr. Kershaw's head off for him."</p>

<p>Ralph could not help laughing again at the remembrance
of the scene, and Mr. Gilchrist joined in his
merriment.</p>

<p>But soon there was no more time for jokes or laughter,
stern reality claimed all their attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist was sitting one day upon a lounging-chair,
beneath the shade of an awning, when the captain approached
him with anxiety plainly imprinted on his face.</p>

<p>"How now, Rogers?" said he; "your face is as long as
from here to there!"</p>

<p>"And with good reason too," replied the captain; "I
fear that a terrible calamity has come upon us."</p>

<p>"Why, my good fellow, what can be going to happen
now?" cried Gilchrist, alarmed in his turn.</p>

<p>"Fire," said Rogers laconically, but with grave emphasis.</p>

<p>"Fire!" exclaimed both Gilchrist and Ralph at the
same instant, staring around them in perplexity upon the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
placid sea, the sunny sky, the swelling sails, the pennon
idly fluttering on the breeze. "Fire! Where? How?"</p>

<p>For all answer the captain pointed to a few slender
spiral coils of smoke, issuing from the seams of the deck
where the caulking had worn away.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist looked aghast.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the cargo?" he asked fearfully.</p>

<p>"Even so," said the captain. "It may be only heating
from water reaching it during the storm. We are going to
open the hatches and see if we can put it out, but I fear
that the mischief was done when we loaded the coal. It
was such wet weather while we were taking it on board.
Gilchrist," said he, lowering his voice, "if there is anything
particularly valuable among your things, put it up in small
compass, and be ready for the worst in case we have to take
to the boats."</p>

<p>"Do you anticipate such a thing?"</p>

<p>"It is always well to be prepared."</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist had many things&mdash;books, maps, scientific
instruments, collecting cases, a costly binocular microscope
with all its appliances, and other articles, nothing having
been spared for his equipment; but in the shock of this
surprise he forgot them all, and, springing from his chair,
hurried to the scene of action.</p>

<p>The whole crew gathered hastily around to know the
worst, and gazed with blanched faces at each other as the
hatches were carefully raised.</p>

<p>A universal cry of horror escaped them, when such a
cloud of steam and smoke, with so sulphureous a stench,
rushed out, upon vent being given to the hold, that they
were driven back gasping for air.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" cried Mr. Gilchrist, "there are two
thousand tons of coal down there! The Lord have mercy
upon us!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"How far are we from land?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I suppose that it depends greatly on
the wind for calculating the length of time it will take
us to reach it. I believe the captain hoped to make
Moulmein in about a week or ten days more."</p>

<p>"Where is that hose?" thundered the captain. "Bring
it here at once. Douche the hold well. Mellish, we must
try to jettison the cargo, and make room for water enough
to reach down the hold."</p>

<p>"Right you are, sir!" cried the first mate. "Who
volunteers?"</p>

<p>The hardiest men among the crew pressed forward.
Two parties were quickly told off, one to relieve the other.
The men flew to the pumps and hose; all was excitement
and hurry&mdash;not a soul of them flinched.</p>

<p>"Here, give me hold of a bucket," cried Mr. Gilchrist,
taking his place in a line of men hauling up sea-water to
supplement the volumes from the hose.</p>

<p>Ralph rushed to assist at the pumps. Streams of water
poured down the hold; volumes of steam arose, hissing,
through the hatchways. It was long before the bravest of
the men could descend, no one could have breathed in
such an atmosphere; and when two leapt into the chasm
at last, they had immediately to be drawn up again, fainting,
scorched, choked with the sulphureous fumes.</p>

<p>They were laid on the deck, buckets of water dashed
upon them, and they came, gasping, to themselves.</p>

<p>"'Tis of no use, mates," said they. "The mouth of hell
itself could be no fiercer."</p>

<p>It was indeed like looking down the crater of a volcano
to glance into that awful depth&mdash;the fire had got complete
hold of the coal.</p>

<p>"We must take to the boats, sir," said Mellish.</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied the captain. "We have no security
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
yet from that cyclone,&mdash;did boats fall into its clutches, there
is no chance for them. We may skirt it in the barque by
God's providence; it blows from the west'ard quarter, and
its tail may help us towards the mainland quicker than
boats would take us. Batten down the hatches, but leave
the hose room for entrance, and keep up the water as much
as we can. Provision the boats, and have everything ready
to man them quickly when all hope is over; but we stick to
the old girl to the last gasp."</p>

<p>There were two large boats, both capable of holding ten
or twelve men; two smaller ones, which could accommodate
six or eight each; and the captain's gig, usually manned
by a similar number.</p>

<p>It would require the whole five to receive all the crew,
for it consisted of twenty seamen, an apprentice, Ralph, a
cook, sailmaker, carpenter, boatswain, three mates and the
captain,&mdash;thirty souls besides Mr. Gilchrist. Even with all
the five boats there would be but little space to save much
of their possessions, but there was the less demand for this
as the men, taking fright at the state of the cargo, refused
to go below even for their own kits. Indeed, the stench of
sulphur, and rapid spread of the smother, justified them in
their fears.</p>

<p>The cook's galley and the storehouses were on deck, the
latter in the poop, close by the captain's cabin, and the
former amidships; it was therefore easy to store the boats
with a sufficiency of provision and water, and Captain
Rogers proceeded to tell off the men for each.</p>

<p>He himself must be the last to leave the ship; and
equally, of course, must Mr. Gilchrist be considered among
the first. He must go in the first boat, commanded by
Mellish; eight seamen, Kirke, and the carpenter would
form its complement. But Mr. Gilchrist refused.</p>

<p>"No," said he. "I am an interloper here, it is right
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
that I should come last, and leave these poor fellows to
have first chance of their lives. Put a married man in my
place, there is no one dependent upon me at home."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Captain Rogers, "you are my charge, I must
see you safe first."</p>

<p>"My good fellow," replied Mr. Gilchrist with determination,
"do not waste time in arguing; I go with you."</p>

<p>"And I too, uncle," said Ralph. "Do not ask me to
part from you."</p>

<p>"For you, boy," replied the captain, "right and good,
you are as my own, and ought to take risks with me; but
for you, Gilchrist, think better of it."</p>

<p>"Now, Rogers," said Mr. Gilchrist, "why waste time?
Don't you know when a man has made up his mind?"</p>

<p>There was indeed a general perception that time was
short, the men worked with all their might, and the boats
were stored rapidly. The three mates and the boatswain
were each to command one; the coxswains were selected
from the best of the seamen, and every man was given his
place, to which he was at once to repair upon a given
signal.</p>

<p>Was it wise to wait longer before embarking in them?
A dead calm had fallen, an ominous stillness pervaded the
atmosphere, no breeze, not the faintest sigh, was there to
swell the sails, and a brassy sky in the west received the
sinking sun.</p>

<p>And the little coils of smoke grew larger, they writhed up
from crack and cranny like snakes, and span and twisted,
puffed and swelled, with horrible sportiveness.</p>

<p>The men worked in silence, casting fearful glances on
this side and that, as they trod those decks which formed
so slight a protection for them from the fiery chasm beneath.
They gathered in groups as the night fell with the rapidity
of those latitudes, but they did not talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>In the quiet they could hear little slippings of the coal,
little reports now and then, and they fancied that a sullen
roar might be distinguished, now gathering volume, then
dying away.</p>

<p>The night was very dark,&mdash;was it the looming storm or
the furnace beneath them which made the air so oppressive
and close? Nothing could be done without light, and the
suspense was horrible. Every now and then the captain,
holding a lantern low, swept the decks, examining to see
whether the smoke had increased or lessened. There
appeared to be but little difference, but such change as
there was lay in the direction of increase.</p>

<p>Thicker and thicker grew the gloom, blacker and blacker
the night, heavier and heavier the sultry air. Then a faint
moaning was heard among the shrouds, a hissing on the
surface of the water, and the cyclone broke upon them
with a cry as of demons rejoicing over their prey.</p>

<p>The vessel gave a shudder like a living creature, then
bounded forwards, heeling over from force of the wind in
the most perilous manner; every cord straining, every sail
swollen to its utmost tension.</p>

<p>It was but the edge of the cyclone, but even that gave
them enough to do. The sea boiled around them; great
waves tossed the devoted ship on their crests, and buried
it in their trough, driving it onward with fury all but
unmanageable.</p>

<p>Then rose up a wall of water above their heads, it dashed
down upon the decks, and rushed out from the scuppers
in foaming streams; and in the next instant the mainsail
was torn from its holdings, the mast gave way with an
awful rending and crash, and beat about to this side and
that, to the peril of all around.</p>

<p>"The boats! the boats!" shrieked the men.</p>

<p>"Take to the boats!" shouted Rogers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>They sprang to the davits to loosen the boats, and the
howling wind took the gear in its teeth and wrenched its
supports from their hold, whirling the two first boats away
as if they had been feathers.</p>

<p>Floods of water poured over the decks, making their way
plentifully down into the hold through a thousand clefts
opened by the straining timbers, and the steam rose in
thicker and hotter clouds as they washed away.</p>

<p>Then a lull came,&mdash;were they out of the line of the
cyclone?</p>

<p>"Cut the ropes of the starboard boats," cried the captain.
"We can hold out no longer. 'Tis life or death."</p>

<p>Again was the effort made,&mdash;again did failure greet the
devoted men; the smaller boat was swamped at once.
Better fortune served them over the others; the large one
and the captain's gig were lowered safely, and the men
crowded into them with headlong speed, many throwing
themselves into the seething water in their haste, some
to be hauled on board by their comrades, and more than
one to be swept out of sight for ever.</p>

<p>Hardly could the united efforts of the captain, mates, and
Mr. Gilchrist control the panic: they stood, silent and firm,
with set teeth and blanched faces, as the seamen crushed
past them and dropped over the side, only endeavouring
to withhold them so as to give each his fair chance of
escape. Minutes were like hours; the crowd lessened,&mdash;cries
and shouts for haste rose up from the thronged boats.
Captain Rogers turned, caught Ralph by the arm and
swung him over the side; Mr. Gilchrist slipped down a
rope and was hauled in; Mellish leapt; the captain stood
alone, the last of all.</p>

<p>He looked hurriedly around&mdash;all were gone, his duty done,
and he too threw himself into the gig.</p>

<p>So hampered were the rowers by the mass of living
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
creatures crushed into so small a space, that they could
hardly manage their oars; the boats were weighted down
to the water's edge, and had not the storm spent its fury
in that last awful burst, all hope of living in such a sea
would have been futile.</p>

<p>But the hand of Providence was over them; they shook
down into something like order, and rowed away from the
doomed ship with all the expedition they could raise;
and not one moment too soon; for, hardly were they at
a safe distance, when, with an awful roar,&mdash;a splitting and
crashing of timbers,&mdash;an explosion like the crack of doom
itself,&mdash;the deck was forced upwards, its planks tossed high
in air, as if they were chips, by the pillar of white steam
that rose exultingly into the sky; great tongues of flame
shot rapidly up through it, crimson and orange among
rolling volumes of smoke; and the rising sun paled before
the glowing fiery mass that reddened the waters far and
wide ere it sank into their bosom, leaving its débris of
burnt and blackened wastry floating idly on its surface.</p>

<p class="pmb3">A groan burst from the white lips of the men as the
seething ruin that had been their home for so many weeks
disappeared slowly from their gaze.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<small>THE RAFT</small></h2>


<p>What were the occupants of the boats to do? What would
become of them? Twenty-six men in boats only meant to
accommodate eighteen at most, and these with but little food
or water, no change of clothes, few comforts of any kind,
an insufficiency even of necessaries,&mdash;and they were within
the tropics.</p>

<p>The sun rose up in fierce majesty, and blazed down upon
them like fire itself. Some had no hats, and suffered
terribly from this cause. The sea was like molten metal
heaving close around them; the crowd impeded all proper
use of the oars or sailing gear. Of this last the captain's
gig had none.</p>

<p>The men looked at each other with haggard eyes, despair
in their faces. It would require but a slight touch to make
them abandon themselves to hopelessness, losing heart altogether,
and becoming demoralised.</p>

<p>They must be induced to do something, to strike a blow
for their own salvation, or all would be lost.</p>

<p>Rogers was the right man in the right place here. Out
broke his cheerful voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the last of the old <i>Pelican</i>, my boys!
She dies gloriously after all. No ship-breaker's yard for
the gallant old girl!"</p>

<p>He led the cheers, which were echoed but faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis well," pursued he; "'tis a crowning mercy that we
are in the current which sets into the Barogna Flats. It
will bear us along softly and well, barring any more cyclones,
but it is not likely that we shall have another of those wild
customers now. It has swept over for the time, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Will you not make for Diamond Island, sir?" asked
Mellish, the first mate.</p>

<p>"By all means," said the captain, "if we are able to
<i>make for</i> anything. But, my good fellow," dropping his
voice, "we must take our chance of getting <i>anywhere</i>. In
this crowd we cannot hold out long, neither can we pick
and choose our course. We can practically only drift, and
keep up our hearts."</p>

<p>"We are nearly sure to be met by some ship going into
Rangoon," said Mellish, speaking with more certainty than
he felt.</p>

<p>"There is a light on the Krishna Shoal, if we could
reach that," said Kershaw, the third mate. "I was in
Rangoon on my first voyage, and remember it; a thing like
the devil on three sticks instead of two."</p>

<p>A laugh followed this description of the lighthouse which
all the old salts knew.</p>

<p>"Ay, my lad," said the captain cheerily, "we'll make
for your three-legged devil, and let him take the hindmost."</p>

<p>"Zur," said old Wills, touching his forelock, "there'm a
lot of spars and timbers afloat, would it not be best to try
and draw enough in to make a catamaran, like az we used
to be teached to make for a pinch when I wor in the
navy?"</p>

<p>"A catamaran!" exclaimed young Kershaw. "Why, man,
what good would that be so far to sea? You may see them
by the dozen off shore, but how do you propose to make one
here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"From timber-heads and greenhorn, zur," replied the old
fellow very demurely.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can?" asked Rogers, who was thinking
too intently to have noticed this byplay. "The boats
are of such different sizes."</p>

<p>"'Twon't be a fust-class affair, your honour," replied Wills.
"Not az if we had her blessed Majesty's resources to hand;
but Osborn here, he du knaw what I mean so well az any,
and I daresay there's others too."</p>

<p>"Ay!" cried two or three.</p>

<p>"'Twould give more elbow-room d'ye zee, zur."</p>

<p>"It would," said the captain; "but you could not do it
unless the boats were nearer of a size, I am convinced."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, sir," said Mr. Mellish, "but there seem to
be a lot of casks among the wreckage. If we could haul in
half a dozen oil hogsheads, and put them three of a side, we
might contrive what would relieve both boats considerably.
Then we might leave the big boat to keep that company,
and push ahead with the gig to fetch help."</p>

<p>"Right you be, zur," said Wills.</p>

<p>There was a coil of rope in the large boat, they made a
running noose in it, and endeavoured to fling it over some
of the coveted casks; but the difficulty was enormous,
partly from want of room in which to work, and partly from
the danger that floating wreckage might swamp their boat,
and so destroy their only chance of life.</p>

<p>Some spars and staves were collected, suitable to the
purpose, but the sea was much agitated from the recent
cyclone, and the difficulty of approaching the hogsheads was
apparently insurmountable. The things might have been
alive and spiteful, so persistently did they elude every
wile.</p>

<p>Just when the men, utterly disheartened, were inclined
to abandon the effort as hopeless, the noose caught,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
apparently more by haphazard than by skill, and a hogshead
of oil was drawn alongside.</p>

<p>In their excitement the men nearly upset the boat, and
Rogers had to repress them sternly.</p>

<p>"Have a care, men, have a care! look at the sharks all
about us. You don't want to fatten them, do ye?"</p>

<p>"Broach that cask," cried one among them. "Let the
ile out, 'twill calm the sea."</p>

<p>"Ay!" said Rogers, "let it out."</p>

<p>Another hogshead was brought in now, and, strange to
say, the oil being emptied did make the water smoother as
far as it reached around them.</p>

<p>While the men in one boat redoubled their efforts to
obtain more of these casks, old Wills and his mate Osborn
connected the two empty ones by a spar laid across
and firmly affixed to each end. They did this at the
imminent risk of their lives, for it was necessary to get
upon the spar, in a kneeling position, so as to secure the
ropes firmly, and any slip into the sea would probably
have been followed by a rush of white light to the spot,
and the disappearance of the man, or at least of one of
his members.</p>

<p>Those in the boats watched anxiously the while, crying
out now and then, "'Ware shark!"</p>

<p>As these alarms were half of them false ones, the old
fellows became too well accustomed to them for more than a
passing glance from their work, which became safer for them
as the casks were firmly fastened.</p>

<p>In the meantime a third cask was obtained, but it seemed
all but impossible to attach a fourth. There was one within
approachable distance, but it bobbed a little farther off with
each effort to cast the noose over it. Seeing the impunity
which had attended the efforts of Wills and Osborn, a man
called Whittingham, a strong active young daredevil, got
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
upon the spar, and made his careful way out to its far end,
rope in hand, coiled up, ready for a cast.</p>

<p>He worked himself astride the spar with considerable
difficulty, for the thing was up in the air at one moment, so
that the lookers-on expected to see him flung backwards
into the sea; then down the length would plunge, as if
about to bury itself in some great green cavern, into
which he must go headlong.</p>

<p>It was like riding a kicking horse, but the hardy fellow
kept his hold, reached the hogshead farthest from the boat,
flung the coil, and it fell short though actually touching
the cask.</p>

<p>Reclaiming the length of cord, Whittingham, in defiance
of all prudence, flung himself into the boiling sea and swam
towards the coveted object.</p>

<p>"Come back, man! Come back!" shouted the captain.</p>

<p>"A shark! A shark!" roared the sailors.</p>

<p>Whittingham paid no heed, he reached the cask and got
the rope around it. He had a cord passed round his waist,
and prepared to be hauled back by it, when his awful
shriek rent the air, and a groan burst from the white lips of
his comrades.</p>

<p>A huge shark had rushed swiftly up, and taken the poor
fellow's legs off at his middle. The sea was crimsoned with
his blood, as his head was seen turned, with an agonised
expression, at sight of the certain death come upon him. In
another minute the tension of the strong hands relaxed, and
the man's upper half also disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Ralph hid his face, trembling with horror.</p>

<p>But the men knew well that this was the fate which
awaited them all did the boats capsize before rescue arrived,
and they redoubled their efforts to help themselves.</p>

<p>The fatal cask was drawn in, reddened still with the lifeblood
of poor Whittingham, which had splashed all over it,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and it enabled Wills and his assistants to construct a sort
of oblong frame, supported at each corner by the buoyant
empty vessels. Pieces of wood were laid athwart, the short
way of the raft, which became safer with each fresh plank
as it was affixed.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty was to obtain the wherewithal for
making these planks and timbers secure. There was but
very little rope, and only such nails as clung to the riven
timbers, with a few which Wills, like all carpenters,
happened to have in his pocket. The spars and planks
were irregular in length and thickness, neither was it
possible to rig up even a cord run around the raft, or
any manner of bulwark wherewith to increase its safety.</p>

<p>It could not be navigated by any means, but it could be
towed at the stern of the larger boat, and serve to reduce
the crush of people there, so as give free scope either to
step the mast and sail her, or for the men to use their oars.</p>

<p>Both boats being thus relieved, the captain's gig would
then row away, with a light complement of men, and try
to make Diamond Island, upon which a pilot station was
well known to exist; or the Krishna Shoal, where it was
probable that help might be either obtained or signalled
for by those in the lightship.</p>

<p>With help of the current this was possible, provided the
weather remained calm.</p>

<p>The question now arose as to who should be transferred
to the raft,&mdash;who could best be spared from the boats.</p>

<p>Mellish must remain in command of the large boat, with
Kershaw. The second mate must go with the captain.
The four officers must be thus divided to ensure a head in
case of accident to either one among them.</p>

<p>The crew of the captain's gig must also be retained.
They were picked men, and the most likely to hold out in
case of long-continued exertion or another gale of wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle," said Ralph, "I will go on the raft. I cannot
help in the boat, I do not know enough, but I can make
room for a better man."</p>

<p>"You are right, my boy," said the captain a little huskily.
"You are a plucky chap, and your mother shall hear of this
if any of us live."</p>

<p>"I go on the raft, equally of course," said Mr. Gilchrist
firmly.</p>

<p>"Let we go, maister," proposed Wills, usually spokesman
for himself and Osborn. "Uz will keep an eye on the
young 'un, ef it be only because he'm Miss Amy's chield."</p>

<p>The captain grasped the old fellow's hand in silence, and
two of the ordinary seamen, of less use than the A.B.'s, were
added to the little gimcrack craft's crew.</p>

<p>The biscuit was apportioned out to each as far as it went,
and the gig parted company from its fellows. When nearly
out of sight, the men lifted their oars in the air as a
farewell greeting, and the fast gathering shades of night
engulfed them.</p>

<p>Their companions, both in the boat and on the raft,
watched their disappearance in silence. They were exhausted
with the emotions of the last few days, and the
heavy work of the last twenty-four hours. Little could be
done through the night but wait for the dawn. They set a
watch, and each tried to get some rest in turn.</p>

<p>There had been a question as to whether Kirke should
not have gone on the raft. It would have been fitter for
him to have done so than for Mr. Gilchrist, who, always
delicate, had recently been so ill. He was a guest, if not
a passenger, and should have had the best place.</p>

<p>He had, however, settled the question for himself, allowing
no demur, and the men were grateful to him for so doing.
Most of them were married men, with young children or
other helpless ones dependent upon them. The safety of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the raft was bound up in the safety of the boat. If anything
happened to swamp the boat, the raft was doomed to
share the same fate; whereas, were the raft lost, those in
the boat still had a chance. Those who could work the
oars and sails best were the right men to remain in it.</p>

<p>But Kirke was not one of these; neither his strength nor
his knowledge made him as useful as an O.S. would have
been, but he claimed his place in the boat as an officer,
and there was no time for debate. Captain Rogers let it
pass,&mdash;perhaps he had his own private reasons for so doing.</p>

<p>The men owned no reasons, public or private, for keeping
this much disliked young man among them; they would
far rather have had Ralph of the two; and thought that
Mr. Gilchrist should have been kept in the best place.</p>

<p>They murmured; they made remarks to each other aimed
at the selfish apprentice, and which he perfectly understood;
while Kershaw openly taunted him with selfishness and
cowardice.</p>

<p>Kirke maintained a dogged silence, but his brow became
more lowering, and his mouth more set in a kind of vicious
sullenness every moment.</p>

<p class="pmb3">So night fell.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<small>ADRIFT ON THE OCEAN</small></h2>


<p>Night fell over the shipwrecked men, a strange one for
the denizens of the raft.</p>

<p>There, at least, was peace, and a hearty determination to
make the best of their position.</p>

<p>They had some sailcloth and a boat cloak. The men
arranged the packages, which had been turned out to
disencumber the boat, so as to make a tolerably comfortable
back; they laid down a couple of planks close together,
rolled up the sailcloth into a kind of cushion above them,
and placed Mr. Gilchrist upon it, wrapped in the cloak.</p>

<p>That gentleman would gladly have shared these accommodations
among some of them, but the men would not hear
of it.</p>

<p>"Lord love you, zur," said Osborn, "there's enough for
one, but two wouldn't zay thank'ee for a part. We'm used
to roughing it. 'Tis fine and cool after all the heat and
pother to-day."</p>

<p>Ralph, upon whom his friend urged his wishes more
strongly, only laughed. He seated himself upon one leg
on a packing-case, the other foot dangling; he crossed
his arms on the head of the biscuit-barrel against which
Mr. Gilchrist leaned, half-sitting, and, burying his face upon
them, said he should sleep like a top there, for he was so
tired he could not keep his eyes open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The sailors squatted down, finding such ease as was
possible, and quiet fell over all. The night was a dark one,
and very still; there was not a breath of wind to fill the
sail in the boat, half the men there were getting what
repose they could, and the others trusted more to the
current than to their oars through the darkness. Silence
had fallen upon all there as well as on the raft.</p>

<p>But Mr. Gilchrist could not sleep. He was a nervous,
excitable man, and the new and excessively perilous position
in which he found himself precluded all possibility of sleep.
His senses seemed rather to be preternaturally acute, and
he could not even close his eyes.</p>

<p>The lapping of the sea against the raft, the occasional
gleam of something swiftly passing, and which he believed
to be a shark accompanying the crazy little craft,&mdash;for what
purpose he shuddered to think,&mdash;the occasional sounds
which reached him from the boat, all kept him awake.</p>

<p>He lay, half-reclining, with his face towards the boat,
which was full in his view. He could faintly see the oars
dipping into the water, keeping way on the boat, and
Kershaw's slim figure holding the tiller ropes. Presently
he saw the one set of men relieved by the other, he smiled
to observe the mate's long arms tossed out, evidently
accompanying a portentous yawn, and then he was replaced
by a shorter, broader back, which Mr. Gilchrist knew must
belong to Kirke.</p>

<p>A sort of half-doze succeeded for a short time, then
Ralph changed his position, which startled him into wakefulness
once more, and discontented tones reached him from
the boat.</p>

<p>"What are you about? Steer straight. You will tip us
all over. What's the fellow doing?"</p>

<p>"Dropped my cap overboard. I was not going to lose
it. Shut up!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>A few more murmurs, then all was still again; but, was
he mistaken? did his eyes, unaccustomed to judge of
objects in the darkness, deceive him, or were they farther
from the boat than before?</p>

<p>He peered anxiously into the gloom, and felt certain
that the motion of the raft was changed. There was less
ripple against its prow.</p>

<p>"Wills," said he softly to the old carpenter, who lay
full length within reach of his hand,&mdash;"Wills, there is
something wrong."</p>

<p>The man was on the alert instantaneously.</p>

<p>"Zur?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I fear we have parted the towline," said Mr Gilchrist.</p>

<p>Wills cautiously moved to where the rope had been
fastened&mdash;it hung loose, there was no tension upon it, and
he hauled it in hand over hand.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, "we are lost!"</p>

<p>They shouted to the men in the boat, but the distance
was widening every moment between them. Kirke did
not seem to hear, to understand. The men clamoured, the
first mate arose, took the helm, and tried to turn her head
so as to row back, but the darkness was greater than ever.
Those in the raft could no longer distinguish the boat,
what chance therefore existed of those in the boat seeing
the raft, which lay so much lower in the water?</p>

<p>They raised a shout, hoping to direct their friends by
means of sound, but that hope failed them. They kept
it up till they were exhausted, till a long line of faint
light illumined the east, till daylight leapt out of the
sea and all was bright about them. A little breeze
sprang up with the dawn, the water had not yet quite
calmed down from the disturbance caused by the tornado;
they looked north, south, east, and west, but saw the boat
nowhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>They were alone upon the sea, with but a plank between
them and death; with no means of helping themselves,
with only enough food for one day, and the sharks
swimming around them in sure certainty of their meal
sooner or later.</p>

<p>One of the seamen took hold of the end of the towline,
and held it up for the rest to see.</p>

<p>It had been severed with a knife! It had not been so
rotten as to give of its own accord from the strain put upon
it; it had not frayed itself, or broken at any weak spot, it
<i>had been cut</i>.</p>

<p>They had been cast adrift by their own companions, of
malice prepense.</p>

<p>"God forgive him!" ejaculated Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"Who?" gasped Ralph.</p>

<p>"The unhappy wretch who did this."</p>

<p>Ralph made no further remark; there was but one
among the boat's crew who was malicious enough to be
even suspected of such a crime, and the boy could not bear
to think it of him. But that <i>somebody</i> had severed the
rope, was beyond doubt.</p>

<p>The fierce sun blazed down upon the waste of water,
there was nothing to be done but to sit still and bear it.
Their limbs were cramped from their inability to change
their positions, there was no help for that. Raging headache
came on; there was a small tin pail, and Wills tried
to dip up sea-water and cast it over Mr. Gilchrist's fevered
brow. With the first movement such a rush of sharks was
made to the place as caused them all to shudder. What
had they expected that they snapped so eagerly at the pail?</p>

<p>The men were hungry, but thirst overpowered hunger,
and they must economise their little stock of biscuit and
water. For how many days would it avail to keep life in
them were they not picked up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>About noon, as well as they could judge, Wills served
out a biscuit each, and about a half-pint of water.</p>

<p>Ralph sickened at thought of eating, and laid the biscuit
down.</p>

<p>"That won't do, Ralph," said Mr. Gilchrist. "You must
take what means are in your power to keep your life, it
is your plain duty. Your life is not your own, you are only
placed in charge of it, and will have to render up an account
of your stewardship. How can you tell for what your Master
wants you? He may be preparing you by this terrible trial
for the work He created you to do."</p>

<p>"Lord, zur, 'ee du spit it out like a buke," said Osborn
admiringly. "Eat it now, Maister Ralph, do 'ee now, like
a good chield."</p>

<p>Ralph was fain to smile, and took up the biscuit again,
feeling less sick when he had swallowed it.</p>

<p>At nightfall another was given round, and a few mouthfuls
more water; then the long hours of darkness fell again
upon them, only more endurable in that they were cooler.
They knew that but one more meal remained, the pangs
of starvation must then be theirs. It was no wonder that
they had not much to say to each other, although none
slept.</p>

<p>They were in the track of ships going to Rangoon, that
was their only hope; but so low were they in the water,
so impossible was it to raise a signal in any manner, that
even in broad daylight fifty ships might pass within sight
of them and never perceive their extremity. But there
were no ships to be seen, nothing to break the skyline,
nothing of any sort <i>upon</i> that wide expanse of heaving
water but themselves, while&mdash;the sharks&mdash;the sharks were
<i>beneath</i> its surface.</p>

<p>Towards morning, when the light breeze brought something
of coolness and refreshment even to them, a little
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
oblivion, a temporary half-forgetfulness of all around
came over most of them, deepening into real sleep with
some.</p>

<p>Ralph slept, and dreamed happily. He thought he saw
his mother and sisters walking together. He did not think
it strange that they should be walking on the sea; they were
talking earnestly to each other, when his youngest sister, a
pretty flaxen-headed child of three years old, popped a rosy
face out of the waves at their feet, and bubbled over into
such merry laughter that he laughed too, and woke himself.</p>

<p>"Why, Ralph!" exclaimed Mr. Gilchrist, aroused by so
unexpected a sound.</p>

<p>"Christ Jesus!" shrieked Wills at the same moment,
awakened also. "Christ Jesus! What is here?"</p>

<p>His yell was echoed by all the others, for a huge black
mass reared itself almost above their heads, and was bearing
down upon them.</p>

<p>With the desperation of men at their last gasp they
shrieked out, "Hoi, hoi! Hallo! Hallo!"</p>

<p>Their voices seemed to make no noise, they raised them
impotently to their own ears; but that was only the fancy
of despair, they had a proper volume of sound in reality.
They were heard, answered with an English cheer; English
faces rushed to look over the top of that great thing;
English voices clamoured; chains rattled; word of command
was given; paddles splashed; a boat was lowered; men
dropped into it over the side; a few strokes brought it to
them; and they were taken on board, among exclamations
of wonder and welcome.</p>

<p>So stiff and spent were they that they had almost to be
lifted into the boat, and were assisted up from it into the
steamer which had rescued them; but movement eased
them, and the joyous excitement of all around helped to
restore them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Crew, firemen, officers, passengers, swarmed around them,
to congratulate them, to shake them by the hand, to clap
them upon the back. Hot coffee was brought as if by
magic, and proved a wonderful restorer; wine, food, fruit,
were lavished upon them; dry, comfortable clothes and
beds were ready for their repose.</p>

<p>Oh, how exquisite to feel the cool, clean linen around
them, to bathe their scorched, blistered faces in fair water,
to remove the dirt of days' accumulation, to be revived with
food so delicious to their palates, to feel the sweetest sleep
stealing over them as they laid their heads down in security
once more!</p>

<p>Until they had been fed, clothed, and rested, they were
unable to give or understand information as to their whereabouts;
but so completely had they lost their bearings, so
utterly miscalculated the strength of the current, that
though they had hoped to make Diamond Island, they had
really passed that place, and missed all indications as to the
entrance of the Rangoon river.</p>

<p>The Krishna Shoal had been passed unseen, the Barogna
Flats unheeded. They had never perceived the lighthouse,
or been aware that they were near it, but were drifting
aimlessly about just beyond that place.</p>

<p>The steamer was taking passengers from Rangoon to
Moulmein, where they were landed in the course of the
next day, and carried straight into hospital in high
fever.</p>

<p>The seamen were tough fellows, and soon recovered. Mr.
Gilchrist, though considered so delicate a man, also suffered
less than Ralph, who, having kept up so bravely through
the whole of their trials, now proved to have received
a severe shock to his constitution. His brain was violently
affected, and delirium was most distressing and persistent.</p>

<p>For some days the doctors feared whether he would ever
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
recover his reason even were his life spared to him; and,
when the fever left him, his prostration was great.</p>

<p>Youth and natural good health conquered at last, and he
recovered. Then he learnt that the news of their rescue
had been sent to Rangoon, and joyfully received by his
uncle and shipmates. Rogers had made the pilot station
on Diamond Island, and been helped into Rangoon, where
he was cordially received by the friends of his owners, and
business connections.</p>

<p>The <i>Pelican of the North</i> had been insured, though the
cargo was not. The Liverpool firm of Herford Brothers
was a wealthy and liberal one, Rogers and the other officers
were to return home in another of its ships then unloading
in Rangoon; the seamen could obtain berths in any homeward-bound
vessel.</p>

<p>But there was bad news for Ralph. The firm of rice
merchants to which he was going had failed, and his hope
of a situation in it doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p class="pmb3">For some time the fate of the boat remained uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>


<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<small>THE DENHAMS AT HOME</small></h2>


<p>While the <i>Pelican of the North</i> was making this disastrous
voyage, troubles had fallen thick and plenty upon the
Denhams at home.</p>

<p>With Ralph's departure Mrs. Denham had felt herself
able to take a second lodger. Mr. Benson, head book-keeper
in the firm of Messrs. Herford Brothers, for whom
Captain Rogers sailed, had lodged with her for some years.
He was a quiet retiring man, an old bachelor, who gave
very little trouble, being regular in his habits, which were
simple. He occupied the breakfast-room, in front of the
house, downstairs, and a bedroom, also in front, at the top
of the house.</p>

<p>There was a good-sized room in the front of the house,
above the breakfast-room, originally meant for a drawing-room,
and a bedroom behind it. Mrs. Denham had
occupied the latter herself, hitherto, and made a nursery
of the larger apartment. These she now proposed to let;
she and all the children doubling up at night in two very
moderate-sized bedrooms at the top of the house, and only
retaining one parlour, the large dining-room on the groundfloor.</p>

<p>To make the new set of apartments sufficiently comfortable
to accommodate a lodger, the best furniture from all
her own part of the house was collected in them; they
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
were repapered, repainted, and new carpets and curtains
bought.</p>

<p>Captain Rogers had made his sister a present of money to
assist her in these arrangements, but the greatest economy
was necessary to make it cover these unavoidable expenses,
and those of Ralph's outfit.</p>

<p>Jack and Reggie stained the floors brown; Agnes and
her mother toiled over the upholstery and little adornments;
all looked very nice when finished; but, beneath
the surface, things were not comfortable. The family was
too much cramped for room. A lodger was quickly found,
but the work of the house was greatly increased; and the
tempers of both Jack and Lisa were difficult, and caused
much unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Denham was glad that it was a lady who took the
rooms, for she would not have liked either of her pretty
daughters to help in waiting upon a gentleman except Mr.
Benson, whom they knew so well; and, as her profits would
not allow the keeping of a second servant, it was indispensable
that they should do so.</p>

<p>She superintended the cooking herself, as the maid-of-all-work
was but a cheap willing drudge, unequal to the preparation
of any but the simplest dishes.</p>

<p>Mr. Benson only dined at home on Sundays, but supper
was wanted for him, or chops with a late tea. The new
inmate, Miss Mason, an elderly single lady, took all her
meals in the house, dined in the middle of the day, and
liked her food daintily served. It made heavy work, though
comfort in the family household was sacrificed.</p>

<p>Agnes had a situation as daily governess. She went to
her pupils after breakfast, dined with them, walked with
them, and did not return till nearly five o'clock, except on
Saturdays, when she came back earlier.</p>

<p>Lisa was at school. She was clever and ambitious, eager
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to pass examinations so as to rise in the world. She was
fourteen, and her studies took up all her time.</p>

<p>Jack came next to her in age; but there was a gap in
the family, where one had died between him and Reggie;
and a wider one, where two had died between Reggie and
little Cicely, who was but three years old. The baby was
nearly two, a very delicate child, a great anxiety to his
mother.</p>

<p>Agnes came in one evening in October. It had been a
pouring wet day, and was already growing dark, for she
had a long walk to and from her pupils' residence.</p>

<p>"My dear," said her mother, who sat by a mere handful
of fire, with the baby whining on her lap,&mdash;"My dear, how
wet you are! You will take cold."</p>

<p>"It is only outside wet, mother," said she brightly; "I
will change my shoes and stockings, and soon be dry."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry to ask it, dear," continued Mrs. Denham,
"but Mr. Benson has sent up an office boy to say that he is
bringing a gentleman home with him, and could he have
dinner at seven instead of tea. I had a dish of rissoles for
him, which will not be enough, but there is nothing else in
the house. Would you mind stepping as far as the shops,
and bringing in something which we could get ready in
time?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I can run along very quickly, mamma. What
shall I bring? A fowl to roast? That could be cooked
best, I suppose; and a few sausages. Any vegetables?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please dear, and some coffee; he will like a cup
of coffee after dinner. And some tinned soup; there is no
time to make any, and Monday is such a bad day on which
to get fish. Will you mind bringing it all back with you,
for Maria is trying to finish the washing, and the shop-people
are so tiresome about sending to this distance?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma, I'll bring it all home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a little something for dessert, Agnes."</p>

<p>"Could you not open some of that ginger which uncle
brought home? I'll bring some nice biscuits."</p>

<p>"A good thought, dear."</p>

<p>Agnes stepped along as quickly as she could, but these
errands took her a long time. The nearest poulterer had
no fowls left, and the next one lived quite a mile off. The
omnibuses did not help her, because only a short part of her
way lay along the main road; and her gown, which she
thought safely pinned up beneath her cloak, came loose,
hung down behind in a festoon, which held the rain and
beat around her ankles at every step which she took.
Contending with a heavy umbrella through blustering wind
and driving rain, laden with a cumbersome basket, it was of
no use to pick her way, or try to keep herself dry, so she
splashed through all the mud and puddles, and returned
home, drenched, cold and wretched.</p>

<p>Hurrying up to put herself into dry clothes, she found
Lisa in their bedroom, with books and papers all round
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes, don't put your wet gloves down there!
That is my German paper, just written. How wet you are!
Where have you been? I have wanted you so badly, just
to hear me say these syntax rules. And do tell me what is
the passive form of"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't keep me now, Lisa, I am in such a hurry.
Mamma wants me. Could you not take baby for an hour?
Mr. Benson has somebody coming to dinner, and nothing is
ready. There is Miss Mason's tea to be got too, and Maria
not dressed, and baby poorly. Mamma is driven every way
at once."</p>

<p>"I can't take baby, I have heaps of lessons to do. I
should lose my place if they are not done. How can you
ask me, Agnes?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I must run down, don't hinder me."</p>

<p>"You might just stop one minute to hear me these
rules."</p>

<p>"I really can't, Lisa."</p>

<p>"Ill-natured thing," began Lisa fretfully, but Agnes
could not stay to hear her.</p>

<p>Downstairs was chaos. The washtubs and wet clothes
were everywhere; the two boys clamouring for their evening
meal, and stumping about in their dirty boots; Miss Mason
was ringing for coals; Mrs. Denham had sent Maria up to
dress, and was trying to prepare the fowl with the baby in
her lap.</p>

<p>"Jack," cried Agnes, "you might just take up some coals
to Miss Mason, to help us."</p>

<p>"I'm not a footboy," said Jack ill-naturedly. "Where's
Maria?"</p>

<p>"We are particularly busy; do help," pleaded Agnes.</p>

<p>"Help yourself," said Jack rudely.</p>

<p>"I am helping all I can," replied Agnes.</p>

<p>"Jack," said Mrs. Denham, "do what your sister asks."</p>

<p>Jack did not exactly disobey his mother, but flounced off
to fetch the coal-scuttle as sulkily as he could, and filled it
with a tremendous clatter.</p>

<p>"Here, Reggie, you lazy beggar, you can carry it up; you
are doing nothing."</p>

<p>Reggie took up the scuttle, which, being too heavy for
him, upset upon the stairs, all the coals falling down with
an appalling noise and dreadful mess.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," said he, looking frightened.</p>

<p>"Butter fingers!" cried Jack contemptuously.</p>

<p>Agnes set herself to sweep the stairs and hall clean, drove
the boys into the parlour and shut the door on them; then
hurried to set Miss Mason's tea-tray, and send it up by
Maria, who now appeared in her tidy apron and cap. Then
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
she laid the cloth in Mr. Benson's room, and ran down
to help her mother.</p>

<p>"My dear," exclaimed Mrs. Denham in dismay, "I forgot
all about a pudding, and I don't know what we can do!"</p>

<p>"I brought some tarts in, mamma; and I thought we
could toss up a sweet omelette while they are having their
soup and meat."</p>

<p>"But eggs?" said Mrs. Denham in despair.</p>

<p>"I bought six pennyworth."</p>

<p>"What should I do without you, love?" sighed her
mother.</p>

<p>By dint of great exertion the little dinner was cooked,
and served to Mr. Benson's satisfaction. He, manlike, had
not the slightest idea of the difficulties which had beset his
obliging landlady; or that, though the hunger of Lisa and
the boys had been assuaged with thick bread and butter in
the intervals of work, Mrs. Denham and Agnes had not
been able to spare time for food, and were sinking for want
of it at nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"You must have a nice cup of coffee now, mamma,"
said Agnes. "I made enough when I sent it up to the
gentlemen. And here is a bit of fowl which I slipped into
the oven to keep hot."</p>

<p>"You must take some too, Agnes."</p>

<p>"I'll have mine when I come down. Cicely has never
been put to bed, she is asleep on the parlour floor."</p>

<p>She set her mother down by the kitchen fire to take her
supper, and carried off the baby, now asleep, as well as
the little girl.</p>

<p>Coming down from putting them to bed, she remembered
that Miss Mason's tea-tray had never been removed, and
stepped in to take it down.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," said she, "that you should have been
neglected, Miss Mason. Mr. Benson has company, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
gave us very short notice of what he wanted, so we have
been rather busy."</p>

<p>"My dear," said the kind-hearted Miss Mason, "you look
fit to drop."</p>

<p>"I'm rather tired," said Agnes; "but I am going to have
some supper now."</p>

<p>But before she sat down to it a telegram from the office
was brought in.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong, miss," said Maria, seeking Agnes.
"Mr. Benson, he guv' a sort of a screech when he read it,&mdash;nasty
thing,&mdash;and he says, says he, 'Send Miss Denham to
me,' says he. I can't think why folks ever go sending them
ugly yellow telegrams about, frightening people."</p>

<p>Agnes did not listen to this tirade, she never imagined
that a telegram for Mr. Benson could affect her. Strangely
enough she did not think of Ralph, she was so tired, and
her evening had been so full of pressing trivialities.</p>

<p>But upon her entering Mr. Benson's room, that gentleman
came towards her, telegram in hand, looking so full of
sorrowful compassion that a cold thrill ran through her at
once.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, there is some very sad news come. I
want you to help me in breaking it to your poor mother. I
am deeply grieved to tell you that the <i>Pelican of the North</i>
has been burnt at sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Benson! And Ralph?"</p>

<p>Her white lips could hardly utter the words.</p>

<p>"The crew and passengers left her safely, but the boat in
which Ralph was is missing."</p>

<p>Agnes swayed, turned deathly sick, felt as if she were
going blind, caught hold of the nearest support, missed it,
and sank upon the floor insensible.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Benson nor his friend had ever seen a girl
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
faint before, and were terribly frightened. They tore the
bell down in their agitation; they called for help in tones
which brought everyone around them in consternation;
nobody had their wits at command except Miss Mason.</p>

<p>"Go downstairs, Lisa," she commanded. "Take away
the boys. Maria, go downstairs; Miss Denham has only
fainted, her mother and I are enough to help her."</p>

<p>She assisted Mrs. Denham to lay the poor girl flat, to
loosen her dress and sprinkle her face with water, as she
spoke. She fetched salts; and when consciousness returned,
she directed the gentlemen to carry her up to her own bed.</p>

<p>None of them, for the moment, thought of asking what
had caused the swoon. Mrs. Denham naturally considered
it the result of over-exertion, and the wetting which Agnes
had undergone; she was much concerned, but not alarmed.</p>

<p>Miss Mason, not knowing of these predisposing causes,
and seeing the telegram in Mr. Benson's hand, guessed
more. She was also much struck with the lack of comfort
in the scantily-furnished bedroom, crowded with two beds,
and littered with Lisa's books in every direction.</p>

<p>Leaving her mother to undress Agnes, she went downstairs
with the gentlemen, and, entering Mr. Benson's
parlour, she closed the door and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"What caused this sudden faintness, Mr. Benson? Had
that telegram anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am sorry to say that it had, ma'am," and Mr.
Benson handed it to the old lady.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said she. "If you had any sense you would
have sent for me, not that poor girl."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," stammered out Mr. Benson, while
his friend could hardly repress a smile at witnessing the
autocrat of "Herford Brothers," before whom twenty clerks
trembled when he frowned, being scolded and scorned by a
neat little woman in a shabby silk gown and white curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>There was wine on the table.</p>

<p>"Before you half kill the mother, as well as the daughter,
you had better bring her down here and give her a glass of
that sherry if it is decent wine," proceeded Miss Mason.</p>

<p>"It is, ma'am,&mdash;it is very fair sherry," said the crestfallen
Mr. Benson. "You don't think that she will faint too, do
you?"</p>

<p>Miss Mason's only answer was, "I will fetch her myself,"
and she walked off.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mrs. Denham did not faint, but it was a most distressing
scene, and Miss Mason took command of the whole family.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<small>MOULMEIN</small></h2>


<p>Ralph was sitting, languid and feeble, in a long chair
in front of the hospital, where he had lain ill for some
weeks.</p>

<p>The hospital was a mile or two inland from Moulmein;
a comfortable place, but Ralph was weary of it. Everything
had a parched, burnt-up appearance; the little pagodas,
to be seen on the surrounding hills, were all alike; the
punkah was working, yet there seemed to be no air to
breathe; nothing suggested freshness, or gave him a start
towards recovery.</p>

<p>A grove of palm trees rose majestically on one hand,
interspersed with tamarinds, and trees of strange form
covered with brilliant flowers.</p>

<p>Along the road came a girl in native dress, carrying a
huge basket of roses, on her way to sell them in the
bazaar. She had the flowers of a white, purple-striped
orchid nestled coquettishly in the coils of her hair; and was
smoking a huge green cheroot.</p>

<p>Then a long procession of yellow-robed "phoongyees," or
monks, came by; each clasping his lacquered begging-bowl,
and staring before him into vacancy, with rapt concentration
of thought.</p>

<p>An open carriage appeared. "Come along, Denham,"
cried Mr. Gilchrist from it, "the doctor orders a drive
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
for you, and we will go out to the Battery Point, to see
whether there is not a breath of air to be met with there."</p>

<p>"It will be very nice if there is," said Ralph; "this
place is like a furnace. Is it always as hot as this here, Mr.
Gilchrist?"</p>

<p>"Not always. The rains are at hand; after that it will be
cooler."</p>

<p>They drove out to the Point, watching the native boats,
light, square-sailed, fitted with thatched houses, rowed with
great difficulty against the stream, by men standing, instead
of sitting, to row.</p>

<p>They looked out over Washing Head Island, with its
pagoda mounting guard over the Holy Well, whence, it is
said, is drawn the water in which the king once a year
cleanses his sacred head.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant evening, and Ralph felt its refreshment.</p>

<p>"I am very anxious," he said presently,&mdash;"I am very
anxious to get quite well; for, unless I can get something to
do, it will be 'up a tree' for me. I don't know how I am
to pay all the expenses I am costing now, or to get a new
outfit, or earn my living at all. I lie and fret dreadfully
about this."</p>

<p>"You have not been yet in a fit state to bear much talking,"
replied Mr. Gilchrist, "or I would have relieved your
mind. Your uncle wrote to me before he sailed for home,
desiring me to let you want for nothing. Herford Brothers
are disposed to be very liberal; and the captain's possessions,
at least, were insured. Compensation will, I believe, be
made to you; and there is little doubt but what this will
take the form of a clerkship in the Rangoon house&mdash;a
much better thing than the place you have lost. Your
luck will be great if you get a berth in that house, for it
is quite the first in the trade. But, Ralph, this must
await letters from England. I also must await the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
replies from home, for all my scientific apparatus must
be replaced there, and sent out to me; in the meantime
the Rangoon house makes itself responsible for our
expenses."</p>

<p>"It is very liberal of the Messrs. Herford," said Ralph. "I
have no claim whatever on them."</p>

<p>"That I dispute," replied his friend. "You did your
share of work for your passage, and did it so well and
willingly that it quite entitled you to a claim upon them,
for they made the agreement to let you go on those terms.
You have suffered nobly; never a complaint whatever the
hardships, for which you never bargained. You have lost
everything you possess in their ship; and, besides all this,
what can we not say of your attention to me, nursing me
day and night, as you have done so kindly, and which
was certainly not in the letter of your agreement. I am not
ungrateful, my boy."</p>

<p>"You have been so kind to me, sir, teaching me, and all
that. One would have been a brute to do less."</p>

<p>"Well, that is your way of putting it; mine is not
exactly the same. But, Ralph, I am feeling better than I
have done for years. This climate suits me, and will, I
hope, suit you now that you have taken the turn. I will
tell you what my plan is for you. I want you to go
with me upon my orchid-hunting expedition. It will
give your brain a rest, and set you up after this illness.
The best time for the plants will come on when the rains
are over, and the season be at its coolest. I mean to
get what appliances I can here, and make a short expedition
into the jungle around this place; then sending what
I can collect to Rangoon to be shipped home. And by
that time, having received better appliances from England,
also having learnt to speak the language a little better,&mdash;we
must study <i>that</i>, Ralph,&mdash;I shall make my way to Rangoon
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
around the head of the bay; searching the various likely
habitations for rare plants, at different elevations and in
different kinds of soil. The weather will then be growing
very hot, but we shall be seasoned to it. I hope thus to
obtain an extremely valuable collection,&mdash;perhaps of insects
as well as of flowers,&mdash;for we shall be collecting in every
variety of weather and locality. Mr. Augustus Herford will
not grudge money to this end; he gave me, virtually,
<i>carte blanche</i> to make what arrangements I found desirable
when I got here; and if we do well, <i>there</i> is your claim
upon him."</p>

<p>"I should like it of all things," cried Ralph, with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, you must be my assistant; and, as we shall need
hands as well as heads, I have spoken to the rest of our
poor raft's crew, and we have determined to keep together,
hoping that our bad luck there will follow us no further.
We feel that we all showed pluck enough over that affair to
be able to trust each other in the future."</p>

<p>"I am sure, sir, that I would trust you anywhere, and
should look upon it as a very jolly thing to go with you. I
like the men, too; we should be ever such a comfortable
party of us. But, Mr. Gilchrist, I don't see that we had <i>all</i>
bad luck with that raft. I am sure it was very good luck
that it never upset. Those sharks swimming about us, like
silent death waiting for us, have bothered me dreadfully
since I was ill. And it was very good luck to be picked up
when we were. Has anything been heard of the boat,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but the very absence of news is some hope.
No wreck of it has been seen, no vestige at all. Ralph, when
I think that we were cut adrift on purpose, from malice, I
think sometimes it may be as well if that boat's crew never
turns up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't say so, don't say so! It was the doing of one
only, and he might have been half mad at the time.
Perhaps&mdash;most probably&mdash;he has been very sorry
since."</p>

<p>"You are a good fellow, Denham, but it would never do
to put more lives at the mercy of a person who could have
doomed six unoffending people to all but certain death to
gratify his own wicked spite. What the Commissioner may
do were he to appear here, I cannot say. If they do turn
up, I wish it might be anywhere else than here. I do not
want to appear against him, yet it would be my duty to
do so. The Commissioner is aware of the fact, and the
severed line is in his keeping. If I had not spoken of it,
old Wills and Osborn would have done so. They are very
faithful to 'Miss Amy's chield,' Ralph. But see, there is
the steamer from the Andamans in the offing."</p>

<p>A long slender line of grey smoke was plainly visible
upon the horizon, becoming more distinct each minute;
and all the European officers and gentlemen in the place
were congregating, in their white garments, upon the
quay to see the vessel come in. Amusement was not too
plentiful for such people in Moulmein in those days; an
arrival of any sort was interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist left the carriage to take Ralph home,
and sauntered down to join the groups that were forming.
Ralph was glad to be alone for a time, he was fatigued
by the conversation, and much excited by the thought of
making this expedition with his friends. The prospect was
delightful to him, and on reaching home he resumed his
former seat, thinking of all he might see, until thought
became dreamy, and dreaminess sleep.</p>

<p>He was aroused by a familiar cheery voice.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! There he is! He has only left half of himself
in the bay!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Kershaw. Ralph sprang up to seize him by both
hands in eager welcome.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kershaw! How glad I am, how very, very glad
to see you again! How were you saved?"</p>

<p>"The steamer for the Andamans, with passengers from
Rangoon, picked us up, and carried us straight on there.
It had some sort of big bug on board who could not be
hindered on his way for such a trifle as the announcement
of our safety, and we have been brought back here as
fast as our own news could have flown. So, like the
clown in the circus, 'Here we are again.' But, Denham,
I'll go back to the Andamans, if they expect us <i>all</i> to
practise Banting here. What have you done to yourself?
You are as thin as a whipping-post, and your face is all
eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been ill! but I shall pick up fast enough now.
People are so kind to us. It is a very good world, after all,
that we live in, Kershaw, in spite of what some folks say."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;'It is a very good world that we live in,<br /></span>
<span class="i05">To lend, or to spend, or to give in;<br /></span>
<span class="i05">But to beg or to borrow, or get a man's own,<br /></span>
<span class="i05">'Tis the very worst world that ever was known,'&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>sang Kershaw.</p>

<p>"Oh, most wise and sapient third mate," cried Ralph,
"you are easily hoisted with your own petard! If folks
lend, spend, and give, do not other folks receive?"</p>

<p>"Let me be among the other folks then. I have lost all
the locks of hair of all the young ladies,&mdash;the dear creatures
who adored me. There's a loss, Denham! Black, brown,
golden, grey,&mdash;they have all gone to disagree with the
sharks."</p>

<p>"Ugh! don't talk of sharks, they haunt me in my
dreams yet."</p>

<p>"They use them for policemen in the Andamans.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Fact!&mdash;the blue ones, because of the colour like the
uniform, you know. They loaf about, round and round,
just like bobbies on their beat; and if any poor devil of
a prisoner tries to escape, and swim to the mainland,&mdash;hey,
presto! they nip him up, and have him in a tight
place in no time!"</p>

<p>"Your experience of life has been enlarged since I saw
you, evidently."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; nothing like foreign travel for enlarging the
mind and perfecting the manners. Perfecting even the
most charming natural manners, sir," said the mate, drawing
himself up, and saluting with one finger.</p>

<p>It was good for Ralph to have this atmosphere of boyish
nonsense restored to him. Between its bright influence,
and the relief of finding his friends alive and well, he
improved wonderfully fast.</p>

<p>All the officers and men of the <i>Pelican</i> came to see
him, and all appeared to be drawn more closely together
from remembrance of the hardships through which they
had struggled. There was but one exception, that of
Kirke, and why he did not form one of that friendly
group must be explained later.</p>

<p>The friends went to walk in the bazaar, amused to see the
shops, or booths, so simply arranged by throwing upwards
the side of the house, and propping it up with a pole; and
the odd conglomeration of articles exposed for sale beneath
this primitive awning.</p>

<p>Here, in a hole simply dug in the ground before the
houses, were Burmese women cooking rice in the joints of
the bamboo.</p>

<p>There were others selling "pickled tea," and other
abominations, by means of weights fashioned after the
semblance of the sacred duck.</p>

<p>Silver trinkets, lacquer ware, earthen jars and pots of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
native manufacture, were oddly mixed up with the commonest
glass and earthenware from Staffordshire and St.
Helens; stuffs of Oriental make and pattern lay beside
Manchester coloured handkerchiefs and Madras muslin
jackets; images of Guadama wore a suspiciously Brummagem
air, and might be seen&mdash;though never sold&mdash;side by side
with lamps of native pottery with distinctly classical shape,
in the establishment of some Chinaman, over whose booth
the picture of his patron saint presided. Mats, baskets,
cylinders of gold, ornamented more or less, and worn by
the ladies as earrings poked through the universal hole
in the ear, were on every side,&mdash;together with Peak and
Frean's biscuits and Bryant and May's matches,&mdash;looking
oddly out of place.</p>

<p>The people who bought and sold were as mixed a lot,
and as queer to the unsophisticated boy's eyes, as the goods
in which they trafficked.</p>

<p>Burmese men and lads, whose close-fitting blue-patterned
garments turned out to be their own skins tattooed; women,
their abundant tresses dressed with exquisite roses or
orchids, but displaying one leg bare to the knee beneath
their gracefully-draped "tameins"; children, even babies in
arms, smoking cheroots; bullock-carts, saffron-robed priests,
officials; half-naked children everywhere, under everybody's
feet; gongs sounding, bells tinkling, laughter
echoing, strange calls and cries and speech on all sides,&mdash;formed
a never-ending entertainment for Ralph, who had
not previously seen more of the world than the rather
dull and prosaic streets of mercantile Liverpool. All was
new to him, all amusing, nothing more so than the idleness
and merry temper of the natives, coming so suddenly upon
him after so stern an early struggle with the grave realities
of civilised life.</p>

<p>The rains were now over, and the pious Burmese, with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
great tenderness for the little fishes left behind in many
pools, collected them in jars, and carried them in procession
down to the river, that they might be thus carefully restored
to their native element.</p>

<p>The fish would doubtless have proved to be as grateful
for this humanity as the fish was to the queen in the old
fairy story, did it not happen that they were nearly all dead
before they reached the water.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Their would-be saviours then ate them, and all ends were
secured. Piety and hunger were equally satisfied, and both
"nats" and men pleased.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />

<small>KIRKE ESCAPES</small></h2>


<p>Kirke's jealousy of Ralph Denham had dated from the
earliest commencement of their ill-fated voyage; and
Ralph had not been as way-wise as an older person might
have wished him to be in avoiding occasions for arousing
it. His own dislike to Kirke's character; his scarcely
concealed contempt of him for throwing away the chances
in life which he himself longed so ardently to possess; the
notice taken of him by Mr. Gilchrist, and of which he was
so proud,&mdash;all tended to inflame Kirke's ill-will towards
him.</p>

<p>Ralph had tried, unavailingly but persistently, to draw
little Jackson from his influence, and Jackson's services
were useful to Kirke.</p>

<p>The two old Cornish seamen kept aloof from the elder
apprentice, and did many little things for their countryman,
as they regarded Denham; and Kershaw, just a trifle older
and higher in the service than Kirke, took to Denham,
laughed and joked with him, sought his society, and made
of him a companion.</p>

<p>Kirke felt his seclusion, and resented it upon Denham.
Such feelings feed upon themselves, and grow apace.</p>

<p>Little Jackson's sudden death was a shock; and, somewhat
softened at heart, though too proud to confess to the
fact, Kirke would have been glad of comfort and sympathy
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Ralph had no idea of this, but, repulsed on his first
evidence of kindly feeling, made no further attempt at
consolation; and Kirke, in his loneliness, raged the more
bitterly in secret because Denham had not found out that
he wanted him.</p>

<p>So one thing acted and reacted upon another, and
culminated upon the unhappy night in the boats.</p>

<p>Envying Ralph's pluck and heroism, admiring him for
it; emulous of their comrades' appreciation of his gallant
daring, he yet could not bring himself to imitate it, for
he felt so afraid to die,&mdash;he dreaded so terribly what came
after death, which he considered certain upon that raft.</p>

<p>He knew that he was not fit to die,&mdash;his whole ill-spent
life rose up, in one instant, with awful clearness before his
mental vision, and he dared not face its consequences. He
believed in spite of himself, and his faith brought him
nothing but fear.</p>

<p>He hung back, and then resented the plainly-expressed
scorn of Kershaw and the sailors. Mellish, with the
authority of captain delegated to him, stopped their taunts
with a high hand, but was powerless to alter the expression
of contempt upon their faces. Accustomed through all
his early life to the surface respect paid to him as a gentleman's
son, he could not bear the lack of deference now
displayed by the men whom he regarded as his inferiors;
and, when the watch was changed, and Kershaw yielded
to him the tiller, saying, "Here, take the ropes, I suppose
you aren't afraid of <i>them</i>," the climax was reached.</p>

<p>Half-frenzied with pride, anger, jealousy and fear, he
drew out his knife, severed the rope without thought of
anyone but his rival, saw in one flash that he had practically
murdered six helpless and inoffensive fellow-creatures, and
remorse seized him for a prey instantaneously.</p>

<p>No one in the boat suspected him, it was supposed that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the rope was weak or rotten, and gave of itself from the
strain upon it. A shark might have bitten it; no one knew
what had happened exactly. Kirke, in horror at his own
deed, called upon the others in the boat to turn her head,
to row back, to search for the raft.</p>

<p>His agitation, the frantic energy with which he worked,
redeemed him somewhat in his shipmates' eyes, but may
have caused him to steer unequally, injudiciously, wide
of his mark. However it happened, they could find no
trace of the raft, and, though they did for a time hear the
voices of the castaways raised on the breeze, the direction
of the wind made their whereabouts uncertain, and the sound
gradually ceased altogether.</p>

<p>Did that mean that they were gone? Drowned? Fled
before God's judgment-seat, to be for ever witnesses against
him? God knew that he did not mean this! But would
He pardon?&mdash;could He pardon?</p>

<p>Still did the unhappy wretch maintain a sullen silence
as to his deed. He could not confess, and those around
him were kinder to him than usual, perceiving his sorrow,
but ignorant as to its source.</p>

<p>Next day they were picked up by the steamer, and
carried on to the Andamans. Everyone at Port Blair was
kind to them, but the word "murder" seemed to be on
the air.</p>

<p>"What! are you a convict?" someone would ask of butler,
washerwoman, syce, coxswain or coolie. "What are you in
for?"</p>

<p>"Murder, Thakin" (Englishman, sir), would be the calm
reply, with a polite gesture and fascinating smile.</p>

<p>The convicts seemed to think no more of such a crime
than of crushing heaps of cockroaches. Oh, that he could
be equally dense!</p>

<p>They were detained at Port Blair but a very short time,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
when they once more embarked for Moulmein. Upon
nearing the port, the first figure which he descried among
the groups on shore was that of Mr. Gilchrist. He stared
as if he had seen a ghost,&mdash;but it was an avenging spectre.
Within the first five minutes of their landing, Mr. Gilchrist
accused him of the crime of cutting the raft adrift; all
shrank from him with detestation, no one stood forth to
say "I do not believe the charge."</p>

<p>Wills and Osborn confirmed Mr. Gilchrist's accusation;
the two ordinary seamen, Price and Simpson, gave testimony
against him; even Ralph, upon whose forgiving
nature he fastened hope, said, "Oh, Kirke, how could you
have done such a thing!"</p>

<p>He was put into the police guardroom, and a watch set
over him.</p>

<p>What could be done to him he had no idea, and imagination
played strange pranks with his fears. Should he be
sent back to England, in irons, to be tried there, where his
father would be broken-hearted, his sisters disgraced; where
all would appear in the papers; and, whatever the event,
he could never hold up his head again?</p>

<p>Would they send him back to the Andamans, to herd
with those half-savage convicts, mutineers from Delhi, the
scum of Rangoon?</p>

<p>Would they shoot him, or hang him, or flog him?</p>

<p>Image after image of terror succeeded each other, while
the guard gossipped, laughed, and dozed. These men were
careless of their charge. Where should a European go if
he did escape? They paid little heed to him, and he began
to perceive that escape was possible.</p>

<p>Where he should go troubled him not; how he should
live, how travel, without knowledge or help, in an unknown
country where his European face would make him a marked
man. He had some vague misty idea of ruby mines; and,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in his ignorance, supposed these to be scattered about all
over the country. That rubies were to be picked up by
anyone, as nuggets had been streamed out of the sand in
Ballarat by the earliest adventurers, was a fixed notion of
his. He would make his way to such a place, lose his
identity among the rough miners, find some splendid jewels,
make his way to some other port a rich man, and return to
England to lead a better life.</p>

<p>Opportunity presented itself at last. It was the feast of
the "Tawadehutha," the most joyous of all the Burmese
festivals.</p>

<p>Feasting and merriment lasted for three days, and holiday
was observed everywhere. Even the Commissioner was
forced to keep business in abeyance, and leave Kirke in his
easy durance; perhaps the more willingly as, his offence
being so unusual a one, and his family known to be so
respectable in England, that gentleman himself was in
perplexity as to what course he ought to pursue.</p>

<p>So in the guardroom the offender remained, under the
care of the Burmese guard, who cared nothing for his crime,
though they were afraid of displeasing the Commissioner.</p>

<p>It was hard upon them that they should not be allowed
to take part in the jollity which they would have enjoyed
so greatly, and their black scowls and grumbling tones were
comprehended by Kirke, although their actual words were
not understood.</p>

<p>The festival was a religious one, and the <i>raison d'être</i>
was that of presenting gifts to the various pagodas, of which
there are so many in all parts of Burma.</p>

<p>It is regarded as a highly meritorious thing to build a
pagoda, although the erection is practically of no use. It
is not a church, or temple, in which religious services of
prayer or praise are held, or any charitable work carried on.
Their very structure forbids that, for they are solid blocks
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of masonry, upon which graceful cupolas and spires are
erected, painted, gilt, and decorated with many bells.
These bells are gifts, and are sometimes very costly, formed
from pure gold or silver, and set with jewels.</p>

<p>It is good for the soul to present these gifts; but any
repairs done to the building as it suffers from age or
weather, counts to the merit of the original constructor
alone. Therefore, when any rich Burmese wishes to make
his salvation secure, he builds a new pagoda, large or small,
all by himself,&mdash;he does not care for another person's eternal
welfare. Let every man look out for himself in the
kingdom of the "nats."</p>

<p>But gifts are another matter, <i>they</i> are offered to the
priests, and make plenty of show both in this world and the
next; so the pagoda festival is a particularly brilliant affair,
and a very picturesque one.</p>

<p>Long processions streamed through the street, attended
by boys and girls dancing, and bearing in their midst long
bamboo poles decorated with spires covered with tinsel
paper, gilt balls, and all manner of toys, which gave them
the air of gigantic Christmas trees.</p>

<p>Some bore aloft pasteboard images of "nats," or beatified
spirits, who bring good luck to men, acting as guardian
angels. Some carried huge, frightful representations of
"beloos," or demons, who must be alternately conciliated
and treated with every indignity to frighten them away.</p>

<p>Kirke's guard rushed out to exclaim at each fresh group
that trooped past the guardhouse. Many an "Ameh!" was
ejaculated, and this one was admired, that one despised;&mdash;now
great delight was manifested, then contempt expressed
in voluble jabber, and with no reference to their
prisoner.</p>

<p>He cared for none of these exhibitions, so childish in his
eyes&mdash;which were fatigued by the glare and noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>White umbrellas, decorated with frills of paper lace; gold
umbrellas; long bamboos, gilt or silvered; the constant
stream of gay moving figures; the flash of tinsel in the sun;
the beating of drums, carried in carts whose wheels
creaked and groaned in unison; the clashing of bells great
and small; the songs and cries of the thousands of people,&mdash;all
wearied and oppressed his brain almost beyond endurance.
The screams of delight which the guard constantly
uttered, ran through his ears with great distress; and then
the climax arrived, in the sight of a huge "silver tree,"
attended by prancing hobby-horses, and from the trembling
boughs of which hundreds of rupees hung quivering, each
wrapped in coloured tinsel paper, and followed by the
inhabitants of the whole country village which had
furnished it, and who danced like mad around it to the
music (?) of their own voices.</p>

<p>Kirke could bear no more; hoping to be left alone for a
little while, he produced such silver as he had in his pocket,
and presented it to the guard, who seized it with delighted
gratitude, and rushed out in vast excitement to expend it in
pickled tea, leh-pet, cheroots, and sweetmeats of strange
fashion.</p>

<p>They offered some on their return to their benefactor, all
their sour looks changed into smiles, but he shook his head
and motioned to them to leave him alone.</p>

<p>Surprised and compassionate, they seated themselves on
their haunches outside the door in the verandah, and
gabbled and feasted happily while watching the constantly
passing crowds.</p>

<p>A pasteboard cow is drawn by oxen in the midst of richly
and gaudily dressed people; a cart bearing a huge gilded
pot in which the milk sacred to Guadama is to be cooked;
a gorgeously-attired maiden, laden with jewels, represents
the milkmaid; still more and more crowds yet; more
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
drums, more bells, more songs, more cries, more colour and
noise and flashing lights, more beloos, more nats, more
hobby-horses.</p>

<p>Night fell, and the revel was still maintained. Torches
and fires cast a strange and lurid light over the motley
scene.</p>

<p>What is this terrible figure advancing? A huge snow-white
serpent, a hundred feet long, fierce fiery red eyes
glaring from out the voluminous coils of its luminous body,
as it writhes on its slow onward course in pursuance of a
great rolling ball of light.</p>

<p>The Burmese excitement could stand no more. Springing
from their heels, they rushed down from the verandah
to greet the apparition with dance and shout like the rest.
They ran, shrieking with admiration, along with the multitude,
and Kirke was left alone.</p>

<p>It was an opportunity not to be missed. All Moulmein
and the country side about it were in the streets, his figure
would be unnoticed among the rest; he arose hastily, and
ran out from the guardhouse into the town, where the
brilliancy of lights in some parts made the obscurity deeper
than ever in others.</p>

<p>No one observed him, no one spoke to him; he hastened
along at his greatest speed, at first mixing with the people,
then choosing the quieter places, fearing lest any English
should see him and recognise him. Everyone was, however,
attracted by the gay sights around; the English residents
were chiefly in their own bungalows, watching the processions
from their own verandahs, and distributing gifts as the
various groups paused before each house to display themselves.
No one thought of him, and he stole along in the
darkness out into the vast misty unknown country beyond
the town, unperceived.</p>

<p>When the processions had all reached the great pagoda;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
when the mystery play was over; when the old legend of
Guadama being nourished by the sacred milk was acted
out; when all were tired, the lights out, the crowds
dispersed, the fun over,&mdash;the guards bethought them of
their trust, and returned to take it up again.</p>

<p>In dismay unutterable they found their bird was flown,
nor could he be found anywhere. In great alarm they
made up the best story they could for the Commissioner's
ears; and, to their wonder, found him strangely lenient to
their misdemeanour. In truth, the great man was thus
relieved from a dilemma; he pretended as much wrath as
the carelessness of the guard deserved, but was almost
grateful to them in his heart.</p>

<p class="pmb3">A search was instituted for the prisoner; but not very
vigorously prosecuted, and soon abandoned when no signs
of him could be discovered.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />

<small>NEWS FROM RALPH</small></h2>


<p>"Oh, that I had never allowed him to go!" wailed Mrs.
Denham, the morning after the alarming telegram arrived,
rocking herself to and fro in her misery, tears streaming
down her face. "My dear, dear boy! He went to help
me, and this is the end of it. The best, the dearest, the
most unselfish boy in the world! How can I bear it! how
can I bear it!"</p>

<p>But Agnes, when she recovered, showed much sense and
strength of mind.</p>

<p>"Mother," said she, "it only says that the boat is missing,
it does not say it is lost. Those seas are full of vessels,
please God some ship has picked them up, and dear Ralph
is safe yet. Do not despair, God is good."</p>

<p>"You are my only comfort, Agnes," sobbed Mrs. Denham;
"but, oh, if I had only refused to let him go!"</p>

<p>"Agnes is right," said the sensible Miss Mason. "Your
son did his duty in taking the chance offered to him, and
God is merciful. You must trust to Him, Mrs. Denham.
Agnes, my dear, you are not fit to go to your pupils to-day.
I have written a note, and Jack can take it before he goes
to school."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, ma'am," said Agnes. "Mrs. Dallas is
particular. I am quite well enough this morning; the walk
will do me good. I mean to be brave, and keep up heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>She smiled, but it was a wan smile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," replied the little old lady, with
secret admiration of the girl's resolution. "Duty and work
are a real help in trouble."</p>

<p>Miss Mason became a firm friend to Agnes from that
time. She was a lonely woman. Death had lately robbed
her of all who were near and dear to her; it had lessened
her means, and taken her home from her; but she had an
affectionate heart, into which she took her young acquaintance
from that time, and found an unexpected source of
happiness in so doing.</p>

<p>Many were the little ways of relieving the strain
upon Agnes which she found. She allowed Lisa to bring
her school-work into her parlour for preparation; and
the quiet harbour of refuge proved to be an immense
boon, and lessened the constant irritation of the girl's
temper.</p>

<p>She often took Cicely to walk with her; she taught her
to read, and quite took her off her mother's hands.</p>

<p>In another week, a second telegram assured the family
of Ralph's safe arrival at Moulmein; but all particulars
had to be sent by post, and before they arrived all the
children were down with measles.</p>

<p>Lisa and the baby were excessively ill. Lisa's lungs
were much affected, she had been growing very fast,
and the time of year was against her; while the complaint
seemed to bring out latent mischief in the baby's
constitution: spinal disease asserted itself, and the medical
man pronounced that, if he lived, he must be a hopeless
cripple.</p>

<p>Agnes, who had taken the measles in the first instance
from her pupils, was left with a cough which every east
wind aggravated, and she became thin and pale.</p>

<p>The assurance of Ralph's safety was a great cordial, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the letters which arrived by post, in due course of time,
brought with them renewed anxiety. They related only
the bare facts of the escape from the ship, and that of
Ralph's severe illness.</p>

<p>Captain Rogers had sailed from Rangoon so quickly as to
have missed Mr. Gilchrist's account of particulars, addressed
to him there and reposted to him in Liverpool. Thus,
though he himself arrived very soon after his own letter
to the firm, he knew little or nothing further.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Herford wished him to go out again as soon
as possible. They had every confidence in him, attributing
no blame whatever to him for the loss of his ship; but an
official inquiry into the circumstances was inevitable, and
all the appliances for Gilchrist's orchid hunting had to be
renewed, besides the usual business of loading his new ship.
He ran down to Cornwall to see his wife, and was obliged
to be in London about the business, so could scarcely spare
time to see his sister.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as Mr. Gilchrist's letter arrived, a copy
of it was sent to Mrs. Denham; and the same post brought
one to her saying that her son was out of danger, and
relating details of his recovery.</p>

<p>These letters did more than relieve the terrible suspense
of Mrs. Denham and her family, they aroused the deepest
interest in the minds of all in the office of Messrs. Herford
Brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. Augustus Herford, talking over the matter with the
captain, complimented him highly upon the conduct of his
nephew.</p>

<p>"He must be a lad worth helping," said he; "and the
mother, for whose sake he has plunged into so much danger,
shall not be forgotten. What other family has she,
Rogers?"</p>

<p>"Two more sons, sir, younger, and whose education is
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
difficult to accomplish,&mdash;a crippled infant, who must always
be a burden,&mdash;and three daughters."</p>

<p>"Six young children!" exclaimed Mr. Herford. "Poor
soul, poor soul!"</p>

<p>He was a rich and liberal man, and acted upon his impulse.
A situation was offered to Ralph in the house at Rangoon,
where he might rise more rapidly than in England.
Reginald was put into Christ's Hospital; and Jack should
be apprenticed to his uncle as soon as he was fourteen.
This would not be for nearly a year; but Reginald went
soon, which relieved the crowd in the house,&mdash;and Ralph's
heroism, the illness at home, and the dreadful suspense as to
his brothers fate, had exerted a very favourable influence
over the boy's character.</p>

<p>He saw how Ralph was respected and admired; he
witnessed how much he was beloved and missed at home,
and determined to win the same regard if possible. At
anyrate, he would not disgrace his brother. The hope of
soon entering upon a manly career added to his improvement;
his last few months at home should be useful in
leaving a good impression behind him, and little annoyances
which would so soon be over were more easily borne.</p>

<p>Ralph would have been more surprised than anyone had
he realised how widespread the consequences of his own
simple adherence to duty had become, or how his own
dear ones benefited through it.</p>

<p>Time passed on, the invalids improved in health; spring
advanced, and a letter arrived from Ralph himself, saying
little of his troubles, but full of the kindness he had received,
and the pleasure with which he was anticipating his
journey with Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"Kershaw, my friend, is on his way home," he wrote in
conclusion. "He has promised to call and see you, dear
mother. I have sent a few trifles for you from the bazaar
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
here, and he will tell you much which I am hardly strong
enough yet to write about."</p>

<p>It was not long after receipt of this letter before a tall,
good-looking, sunburnt, and extremely grave young man
called one evening. He proved to be Ralph's friend, the
mate Kershaw, and he was received with effusion. Tea was
just ready, and he was at once invited to remain to partake
of it.</p>

<p>Miss Mason was fetched down, and questions about the
dear absent one poured out upon him. He replied to everyone
with the most demure politeness, but it was not long
before Agnes, as well as some of the others, observed a
twinkle in the bright eyes, not exactly in accordance with
the gravity of his manner. Also some of his calm observations
were, to say the least of them, startling.</p>

<p>There was home-made saffron-cake on the table, and Mrs.
Denham offered him the plate.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he, "no wonder that Denham is a little dissatisfied
with Burmese cookery, when he gets such cake as
this at home."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you like it, for it is a kind of cake which
we Cornish people particularly affect. Do you happen to
have Cornish connections, Mr. Kershaw?"</p>

<p>"No, madam, I am of Irish extraction."</p>

<p>"Irish!" cried Lisa. "I should so like to visit Ireland.
I want to see Fingal's Cave and the Giant's Causeway."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know, Miss Lisa, that the Causeway is
supposed not to be a freak of nature but of man's manufacture."</p>

<p>"No, I never heard that," said Lisa. "What ground is
there for supposing such a thing?"</p>

<p>"There are so many sham rocks in Ireland," said he
sadly.</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Lisa rudely. The others laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you heard that Ralph is to go up into the
jungle, orchid hunting, with Mr. Gilchrist?" said Mrs.
Denham.</p>

<p>"Yes; it will be a most interesting expedition. I could
have wished to have joined it, only it was necessary to come
home and pass my examination for master. Without my
master's certificate I cannot take a berth as first mate,
you know. Otherwise I should have liked to have gone
with them, natural history is my great forte,&mdash;particularly
Burmese natural history. I should have liked to have
seen the Kain-no-ree, which inhabit lonely parts of the
jungle."</p>

<p>"What sort of creature is that?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"It is the missing link between birds and men, which
Mr. Darwin failed to discover. It has the body of a
bird, and the face of a man, and can talk away like anything."</p>

<p>"What a strange creature! I never heard of such a thing
before. Are they pretty?"</p>

<p>"No, rather queer old birds, but conscientious. They
have tongues which never told a lie. Then the links
between the monkeys and the orchids are as much a question
of degree, only upon one side, as those between
monkeys and natives on the other."</p>

<p>"I believe," said Miss Mason quietly, "that we
occasionally see the latter peculiarity at home. I have
observed it in sailors."</p>

<p>Mr. Kershaw looked up at her. "Present company always
excepted, of course," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly so! particularly when the company present
is of Irish extraction," she replied.</p>

<p>"Miss Denham," appealed the young man, in injured
innocence, "this lady is very severe upon me. Will you not
take my part?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Mr. Kershaw, you did take even me in for a minute.
How can I believe you again?"</p>

<p>"Even you? Was it so? I cry, <i>Peccavi</i>. <i>Even</i> you."</p>

<p>"And now you are laughing at me."</p>

<p>"I? I would not laugh for the world, not even at you."</p>

<p>"I wish I could be even with you, Mr. Kershaw."</p>

<p>"And I wish that I could be evened to you, Miss
Denham."</p>

<p>All laughed there; then Mr. Kershaw's accounts of Burma
began again, in a curious medley of truth and fiction
difficult to separate.</p>

<p>"The Burmese are a very strictly religious sort of folks.
They kick off their shoes to pray, and sit upon their heels.
They must not take life, not even kill their fleas or their
black-beetles; yet they are the most determined murderers
on the face of the earth. There is no country in which
human life is less considered where offence has been
offered."</p>

<p>"But does the English Government allow this?" asked
Mrs. Denham.</p>

<p>"Well, madam, the murderers make such good and cheap
servants, you see. Of course they must not kill the
English."</p>

<p>"I do not know how to believe you, Mr. Kershaw."</p>

<p>"Other ladies have the same difficulty at times, ma'am,
but I may assure you that it is a fact. English people are
perfectly safe from them. Other customs are peculiar.
Whenever they wish for a wet day, they send a white
elephant out to take his walks abroad, and the rain is sure
to come."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Kershaw!"</p>

<p>"It is quite true, madam. It would be done more
frequently were there more white elephants, but there are
very few, and it does not answer to whitewash them.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Unfortunately it is one of those cases where the converse
of a fact does not work in an opposite manner. There would
not be six months of rain at a stretch if sending out a black
elephant would stop it."</p>

<p>"I daresay not," remarked Miss Mason drily. "Will you
take some honey, Mr. Kershaw?"</p>

<p>"No, I thank you, ma'am. Burma has cured me from a
boyish taste for honey. They embalm their dead with
honey there; and, after a time, tap the mummies, in a
spirit of true economy, and sell the honey in the bazaars
to Englishmen unsuspecting of guile. Such honey is said
to be peculiarly nourishing,&mdash;to eat it from the tomb of
your fathers is to taste all the sweetness of friendship
with your venerated ancestors. It is a poetical idea."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kershaw! How can you talk so? Have you no
pleasanter or really beautiful things about which to tell
us?"</p>

<p>"The most beautiful idea of which I have heard there,
is the notion that people's souls are like butterflies, and
that when you dream of an absent friend, it is really
because your butterfly and his have escaped, for a time,
from their prison-houses, and meet in dreamland for a
chat."</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed Agnes, "I wish that my brother's butterfly
would escape this very night, and tell me what he is
doing at this moment!"</p>

<p>"Don't wish that, Agnes dear," said Miss Mason.
"Should he be in pain or difficulty, and you could not
help him, it would be better for you not to know of it."</p>

<p>"How can you say so!" cried Agnes. "I should always
know when he is happy, and if troubles came I could give
him my sympathy."</p>

<p>"Suppose you give it to me, Miss Denham, to keep for
him. I would take great care of it."</p>

<p>"I fear that you would put it away so carefully that you
would not know where to find it at need," said Agnes.</p>

<p>So they chatted on, now in joke, now in earnest, and an
atmosphere of youthful brightness came into the house with
the sailor and dispersed much of its gloom.</p>

<p class="pmb3">He often called to spend a few hours with them, for he
had few friends in Liverpool, and liked all the family. To
Jack he became very useful; and Mrs. Denham grew to
regard him almost in the light of another son.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />

<small>THE LEOPARD</small></h2>


<p>It was a great relief to Ralph, as well as to some others,
when he learned that Kirke had escaped; but the men
were very wrathful, and Mr. Gilchrist both dissatisfied that
he should have avoided punishment, and more than anxious
as to his safety. What, he thought, could such a young
man do in the jungle, or among the half-civilised Burmese
natives, without being able to speak their language at all,
or help himself in any way.</p>

<p>All the weeks which he himself had spent in Moulmein,
and during which he had worked hard to master the
language, only resulted in enabling him to make himself
imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>Ralph, indeed, succeeded better, though by ear rather
than from book lore. With the happy effrontery of boyhood,
he made the most astounding shots at Burmese; and,
though the Burman lads laughed at his mistakes till they
were fain to roll upon the ground from merriment, they,
somehow, appeared to comprehend his meaning.</p>

<p>But nothing availed to make the two old Cornishmen
speak anything but their own tongue.</p>

<p>Kirke had received no lessons, gained no experience,
what could he do?</p>

<p>"My good sir," said the Chief Commissioner, to whom
Mr. Gilchrist imparted his doubts&mdash;"My good sir, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
lad is certain to be discovered, and brought back here.
He is a marked man among the Burmese, and they will
not feed him for nothing. A reward will cause him to
be brought in before long."</p>

<p>"Drat him!" said Wills. "Good-for-nothing never comes
to harm. I hope they there black fellows will read him a
good lesson."</p>

<p>None of them were aware that the apprentice had with
him a considerable sum of money in English sovereigns, and
time passed on, during which nothing was heard about him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the mates and seamen proceeded to join their
captain in Rangoon; Price and Simpson, the two sailors who
had also been upon the raft, electing to go with their
shipmates when they had once more met with them. Wills
and Osborn adhered to their agreement to join Mr. Gilchrist's
party; and that gentleman willingly parted with the others,
considering that Indian coolies, Tamil or Telegu natives,
would be of more use to him.</p>

<p>It was time to start upon the expedition now, and
preparations were soon made. The Rangoon branch of
Herford Brothers' house of business franked all expenses;
and a bullock-gharrie, or native cart, was purchased,
furnished with an awning to protect the travellers from
sun and rain, and drawn by a couple of stout buffaloes.</p>

<p>Light baskets and other means for packing orchids were
prepared; and stores of various kinds were added, as coffee,
tinned meats and biscuits; but they hoped to obtain some
provisions as they went through Burmese villages.</p>

<p>The gharrie was packed, the buffaloes harnessed, and the
travellers were taking their seats, when suddenly a distant
roar was heard.</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried the coolie in charge of the animals, holding
up his finger.</p>

<p>The sound distinctly approached, and shouting some
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
unintelligible words, the fellow goaded the buffaloes into
as rapid movement as possible, hurrying the whole concern
back into its original shelter in the compound.</p>

<p>The reason was quickly made apparent, for black clouds
drove up from the weather-quarter, and sheets of rain
descended upon the hot baked earth, which, unable to
absorb anything like the deluge, allowed it to run off, in
every direction, in plentiful streams.</p>

<p>It did not last long. Before two hours were over the
ground showed but slight traces of damp, the gharrie was
brought out again, and the party set off down the Mapoon
road, following the course of the stream upon the way to
Amherst.</p>

<p>"What did the fellow tie that bunch of plantains up to
the front of the gharrie for?" asked Ralph. "We don't
want fruit all covered with dust and flies."</p>

<p>"That is not fruit for us," replied Mr. Gilchrist, laughing.
"That is an offering for any spirit whom we may chance to
meet wandering about. It might be unfortunate if we
should offend such gentry."</p>

<p>"Is it to warn them of our approach that they let our
wheels make such a creaking? Cannot we oil them, or
something, to stop it? And must we be deafened by those
ugly square bells tied to the buffaloes' throats?"</p>

<p>"I believe that it will be best to try and put up with the
customs of the country in which we find ourselves, Ralph;
at least until we are quite certain that altering them to
please ourselves may not be giving the natives unnecessary
offence. We shall soon become used to such trifles as that.
See, we are approaching the great timber works."</p>

<p>Huge trunks of teak, and other valuable trees suitable
for ship building, were floated down as rafts from the dense
forests up the river, and here cut into suitable form and size
for being transported to England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>It was wonderful to observe the skill and judgment
displayed by the elephants employed in moving these
immense hulks from the river-banks up to the spot where
machinery awaited them. They were no less skilful in
perceiving the best way for pushing, lifting, or driving the
timber, than wary in avoiding the machinery if obliged to
pass near it. Ralph was immensely diverted to observe
how each animal, in making his way by the place where a
circular saw was at work, invariably moved his own tail to
the farther side, so as to preserve his cherished appendage
scathless from injury. He was told that at one time
many elephants had their tails cut off by accident here,
until they learnt caution to this extent.</p>

<p>So much interested and amused were the travellers by all
which they saw in this place, that they proceeded no
farther that day, it having been late when they started;
but the next morning saw them early on their route; and
that day, leaving the high roads, they plunged into forest
paths, and began to make their way through the jungle
in earnest.</p>

<p>They proposed driving to a small Karen village to which
a native had offered to guide them, and which was situated
in a locality where many orchids were reported to grow.</p>

<p>The native hired to show them the way promised that
they should arrive there in "the boiling of two pots of rice."
This was understood to be in about half an hour, but the
little journey really occupied thrice that length of time,
for rain again poured down in a perfect sheet, and the
bullocks could hardly make their way through it.</p>

<p>All were glad when they arrived, and were able to
procure shelter. The houses were raised upon high posts,
comfortably built of wood, and thatched. Whether this
elevation was intended to preserve the family from the
damp, or from wild animals, they could not discover. Mr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Gilchrist thought the form of erection partook of each
reason.</p>

<p>The lower part had a verandah around it, and was floored
a little above the ground with bamboos. The gharrie was
accommodated in a portion of this lower place, and arranged
for the travellers' accommodation at night.</p>

<p>The women of the house prepared them some rice while
this was being done, and served it, with fish upon a
separate platter.</p>

<p>The rain was over for the time when they were rested
and refreshed, so they started for an expedition into the
jungle, with which the village was closely surrounded.</p>

<p>They soon found plenty of orchids, and became so much
interested in the selection of the rarest specimens, that
the light failed them, and they could scarcely "distinguish
the veins in a man's hand," which their Burmese guide
seemed to consider a felicitous method of describing the
hour.</p>

<p>They remounted the gharrie, and were proceeding on
their way with the slow deliberation which formed the
bullocks' greatest speed, when Ralph perceived a huge,
dark mass of something lying right across their path, with
two points of living fire gleaming sullenly from it.</p>

<p>It was an enormous leopard, taking its rest, but with
watchful eyes.</p>

<p>The bullocks, perceiving the danger in the same moment
as the men, made a sudden lurch to one side, nearly
upsetting the gharrie, and causing the wheels on one side
to sink into a mud-hole, half filled with water from the
recent rain.</p>

<p>They stuck fast in this, and the terrified beasts could
not drag them out. They plunged, snorted, and laboured
desperately; while the beautiful sleek brute rose, stretched
himself, and prepared to spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Ralph thought his last hour had arrived, but firearms
were at hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist snatched up a loaded gun, fired, but with
too uncertain an aim, for he could not control the trembling
of his nerves at this first and sudden sight of so terrible an
animal in his native jungle.</p>

<p>The driver of the gharrie, with a howl, abandoned his
seat in front, and crept into the recesses within to hide.
The leopard made his spring, and fastened upon the
nearest bullock. Ralph uttered a cry as desperate as that
of the native, and discharged a pistol full at the creature.</p>

<p>So close upon them as he was, it was impossible to miss
hitting it somewhere; the bullet entered its shoulder, and
a trickle of blood bore witness to the fact.</p>

<p>The pistol was a revolver, and Ralph shot again and
again, for all the chambers were loaded; but his hand
shook, and several bullets went wide of the mark, though
he hit the leopard in the ear and in the side.</p>

<p>The creature abandoned its work of mangling the poor
bullock, when it suffered the first shot, raised its proud
head and looked the boy full in the face; crouched again,
and, lashing its tail with fury, was on the point of leaping
straight into the waggon, when, his arm steadied by the
emergency, Mr. Gilchrist discharged his second barrel in its
face, and shot it straight through the head.</p>

<p>Osborn at the same moment, having withheld his shot
until it was certain to take effect, hit it in the neck, and
the animal rolled over in its dying agonies.</p>

<p>The Burmese bullock-driver now emerged from his
retirement, very glorious over the defeat of the enemy; he
danced round it with joy, and lauded "<i>our</i> courage," "<i>our</i>
success," "<i>our</i> bravery," until old Wills was obliged literally
to spit out his contempt.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" he growled. "Hold your ridiculous jaw!
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Much good you were, you coward! Next time we will
throw you out for the cat to set his talons in those absurd
blue breeches of yourn. Better you than our poor buffalo.
Here, hand me that knife, and let me put the poor wretch
out of its sufferings."</p>

<p>For the buffalo was not dead, though paralysed by the
leopard's teeth and claws in its spine, at the back of its
throat. It turned a pathetic eye upon its friends, as it
asking for help, but there was nothing to be done but to
put it out of its misery.</p>

<p>Ralph shuddered, and felt very sick; Mr. Gilchrist also
was faint when the pressure of excitement passed away,
and Wills made both of them take some cordial to steady
their nerves.</p>

<p>Osborn meantime lit their lamps, and set some flaring
torches into the ground, preparatory to skinning the leopard,
which was a splendid beast.</p>

<p>Ralph collected wood, and built up a fire with some
difficulty, as the rain was coming down again almost like a
waterspout. However, it stopped after a while, the boy
was lavish with his kerosene oil, poured over the damp
branches, and a bonfire rewarded his exertions, drying their
garments, illuminating the wild scene, and enabling him to
boil some coffee, of which they all gladly partook, with
biscuits and other comestibles from their tinned stores.</p>

<p>It was late before the leopard was safely and carefully
skinned. The buffalo was not worth the trouble, being
too much mangled, but the men cut off its head, as the
skull and horns were worth preserving. It would soon be
reduced to bare bones if left to the mercy of the white
ants. To preserve the fine hide of the leopard from them
was a greater difficulty.</p>

<p>The party camped down in their gharrie, with fires set
around them, for the short night, when all was done; and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
proceeded in the cool of the morning to the Karen village.
Here they were received with great delight when the driver
announced the event of the night. The villagers immediately
started to bring in the carcase of the leopard
upon hurdles. Part of its flesh was dried and pounded,
to be used as medicine; but they feasted upon the remains
of the bullock; and tried hard, both by fair means and foul,
to induce Mr. Gilchrist to part with the leopard's claws,
to be used as charms, but he refused all overtures of this
kind.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In spite of this, the poor people were very kind to our
friends, and they made up their minds to remain there for
a few days until they could find a suitable buffalo wherewith
to replace their loss, which did not seem to be easy in this
place, the people being very poor.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<small>WHAT BEFELL KIRKE AFTER HIS ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>Kirke had hurried away from Moulmein as fast as he could
walk. He knew that he must make his way northward
but there all his knowledge ceased.</p>

<p>He had plenty of English gold with him, for he carried
his money in a belt round his waist, and thus had saved it
when he lost all else in his haste to leave the burning ship.</p>

<p>But though he had gold, he had nothing else, nor could
he speak a word of the language.</p>

<p>So great was his desperation, however, that he cared
nothing for this. He walked on and on, till he arrived at
a small village, where, though it was in the middle of the
night, the people were all out and about still.</p>

<p>Some girls were squatting behind a lamp blazing in an
earthen vessel raised upon three pieces of bamboo. They
were smoking&mdash;like everyone else&mdash;and selling sweetmeats
and rice.</p>

<p>Kirke made signs that he wished to buy some, and
offered a George <span class="smcap">IV.</span> coin.</p>

<p>The girls stared at him and his money, jabbered together,
and shook their heads. He did not understand them; but,
supposing that they made some mistake as to the value of
the coin, not recognising it as gold, produced another piece.
He was naturally reckless of money, and now wanted food,
and silver change with which to proceed on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls laughed, nodded, took the second coin, which
had the Queen's head on it, and gave him Indian silver
change in profusion for it, besides rice in a red bowl, fruit,
and sweetmeats, for which they reserved a small amount;
but they would not have the coin with the man's head.</p>

<p>Kirke could not comprehend their objection to it, which
really was their idea that only "woman coins" fructify and
increase, but he was satisfied with the result of his shopping,
and proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>His road seemed to lie between a chain of villages; and,
fearful of being overtaken upon it, where he would be so
easily recognised and caught, he turned off towards the
coast again, soon coming to a stream, across which a man
in a canoe took him.</p>

<p>The sun was now high, and he tried to find a place
where he might lie down and sleep. With some difficulty
he made the boatman understand what he wanted, and
take him to a hut, where they spread a mat for him with
a rug, and he took a long rest.</p>

<p>He could purchase nothing except rice and fruit upon
awaking, but the owner of the hut offered oil and salt
with the former, and some unutterable abomination of
putrid fish, which he called "ngapé," and which he seemed
surprised to find rejected with disgust.</p>

<p>When the heat of the day was over, his host offered milk
and more rice, from which Kirke made a second meal. He
would have liked stronger liquor, but could not make
himself understood. He then obtained a seat in a native
bullock-cart, neither knowing nor caring where it was going,
so that it was still northwards, and not to any English
station.</p>

<p>So he wandered for some days, aimlessly and drearily,
with no object before him, no one to speak to, no settled
plan of action. By degrees he became used to this existence;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
youth restored his energies, he became less afraid of pursuit,
learnt a few Burmese words, and liked this life so full of
new sights and sounds. He came to a large river, the
course of which he followed upwards for several days, for
the rapids in it caused all the people to shake their heads
when he tried to get ferried across.</p>

<p>He succeeded at last, and congratulated himself now upon
being safe, but here his luck deserted him.</p>

<p>He found that there was gold to be got in this place;
and from the contemptuous air with which the people turned
over his coin, and the few flat flakes which they showed
him in return, chiefly worn as amulets, he gathered that their
gold was considered much purer than his, but he did not
seem able to find any of it for himself.</p>

<p>The people also evidently endeavoured to dissuade him
from wandering about alone, making him understand that
there was danger from wild beasts in so doing. This was
a hindrance which had never before occurred to him, but
was a very sufficient obstacle.</p>

<p>The weather was extremely sultry now, and there had
been several violent thunderstorms. The place was mountainous,
and the valleys between the hills grew very wet. To
his surprise the ground never seemed to dry up; though
after a tremendous storm, when the sun blazed out again,
it positively steamed, as a pot of water might steam over
a fire.</p>

<p>The storms became more frequent, the deluges of rain
heavier and more constant, the valleys fuller and fuller
of water. All wandering was at an end perforce, except
in canoes. The people expressed no surprise, they appeared
to be prepared for such a state of things. They all had
boats of some kind or other; old and young, men and
women, were evidently familiar with their management.
The huts were raised upon piles, in some places twelve
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
feet high; even their bullocks and other live stock were
stabled aloft, and the stench from their close accommodation
was all but insufferable.</p>

<p>The children fished through holes in the floors of the
huts; every foul refuse was simply upset through them; all
objects were damp and ill-smelling.</p>

<p>The poor people were very hospitable and kind. They
gave Kirke of their best, charging him incredibly small
sums for his keep. There was no getting away until the
floods abated, but life under such unhealthy conditions was
what none but a native could withstand; and in spite of
incessantly smoking, as they did, Kirke had not been two
months in the village where the rains had surprised him,
before he was down in a raging fever.</p>

<p>There he lay, in that secluded Burmese village, struggling
between life and death for a long time. His constitution
had been severely tried by his early excesses, and had he
not passed some months upon enforced abstinence from
alcohol on board the poor <i>Pelican of the North</i>, so that he
had, in some measure, been restored to a more healthy
state of body, it is doubtful whether it would have been
possible for him to have fought through the terrible fever,
which had been induced by hardship and exposure to
malaria.</p>

<p>His chief chance of life lay in the continuance of the
impossibility of obtaining stimulants where he was. The
Burmese are a water drinking race; and although they do
distil a pernicious fiery liquor from rice, it is not much
used, or easily procured, in such out-of-the-way places as
those into which he had wandered.</p>

<p>Medical science is very imperfectly understood among
this people; and when his host fetched a native doctor for
the sick stranger, he brought with him such strange-looking
compounds in gaily-painted joints of bamboo canes, that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Kirke could not bring himself to trust them any more than
the charms, in which the village Galen evidently possessed
more faith himself. Perhaps this was well for him, but he
was brought to the verge of the grave before the constantly
recurring attacks of ague and fever gradually subsided.
And oh, how lonely he felt as he lay on his bed of sickness
now!</p>

<p>God seemed to have forsaken him; left him to his own
stubborn, hard heart, and allowed him to take his own
way.</p>

<p>But not in reality. Lonely, suffering, weak, with no one
to speak to, none to care for him, none to help him, his
hour had come at last. Broken in spirit, he repented his
evil courses, he sought his God in prayer, and his Father
did not despise his humble and contrite heart.</p>

<p>Exhausted by the struggle through the morning's rigor
which attended his complaint, he lay prone one day, in
what was half sleep, half unconsciousness, on his mat.</p>

<p>A pleasant breeze had sprung up, which rustled the
branches of the trees, and wafted towards him the scent
of flowers, overpowering that of rotting vegetation which
always seemed to pervade everything. It brought with it
also the gentle tinkle of bells from a pagoda upon a rising
ground in this valley. In his half awake state, he fancied
he smelt the Gloire de Dijon roses that grew round the
drawing-room bay window in his father's rectory, and heard
the church bells ringing afar off, calling the villagers to the
Sabbath service.</p>

<p>He remembered how, as a little child, he had been led
by his gentle mother's hand through the pleasant garden
and shrubbery, to the gate which opened thence into the
churchyard heaped with grassy mounds. Among them was
a little white marble cross, over the grave of his baby sister
who had died. His mother stayed her feet at this place,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and laid before it the pure white rosebud which she had
plucked as they went over the lawn. A tear ran down her
cheek as she did so.</p>

<p>"Jamie," said she, "little Leonora would have been five
years old to-day if God had spared her to us. Oh, my
dear little girl, my dear little lost one!"</p>

<p>His father had come up to them. "Not lost, wifey," said
he,&mdash;"not lost, but gone before."</p>

<p>Why did he recall all this now, when he had never
thought about the scene for so long. His mother had gone
before too, ten years ago. He had despised his father's
simple piety because he was not intellectual. He had
scoffed at his attempts to teach him, scorned his affectionate
nature, neglected him for pleasures and friends which had
brought him to this.</p>

<p>What had he done with his stronger mind, his superior
talents? His father was beloved, respected, a welcome
visitor beside many a dying sinner's bed. He himself was
a fugitive, an outcast, alone in the world.</p>

<p>Pondering these thoughts, he fell asleep, for he was
very weak. His slumber was not lengthy, nor did he
seem to have dreamed through it; but he started up from
it suddenly, as at the call of a trumpet voice, shouting
with triumph&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not lost, but found!"</p>

<p>Bewildered, confused, this voice seemed to him real.
What did it mean?</p>

<p>All at once the barriers of pride gave way; there was no
one to see him, and he turned his face to the wall, weeping
bitterly.</p>

<p>A softer, better mood succeeded, and a stronger feeling
of peace than he had felt for long. He determined to
remain in this place until he was quite well; and did so, his
health gradually returning to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Kirke's illness, and long residence among them, had been
to these people as good as a wreck to the Cornish seaside
population of old,&mdash;it had brought unusual prosperity to
them. Small as their charges had appeared to him, they
were really four times as high as the true value of the goods
supplied to him had been to them. The simple villager
was no simpleton when matters of trade and finance were
in question; and, if they prayed at all, their petitions to
Guadama, for years afterwards, would have been that the
Lord of the White Elephant would be pleased to send them
another sick stranger.</p>

<p>He had paid royally for the medicines in those red
and yellow bamboo bottles, which the doctor had carried
away again as full as he brought them. He had paid
handsomely for the rice, the ngapé, the pickled tea
which he could not eat, and over which his entertainers
had enjoyed a high old time while their guest's butterfly
soul was wandering about the world, at sport with
other butterfly spirits, leaving its lawful owner unconscious
upon his mat.</p>

<p>They were now reaping an abundant harvest, doubtless a
part of the luck which their hospitality to the stranger had
brought to them, and they were rich. They did not want
to be rid of their invalid,&mdash;not they. No hospitality was
more genuine than theirs.</p>

<p>If they could only conceal their riches from the knowledge
of the dacoit chief,&mdash;who commanded his band of scoundrels
from a neighbouring village among the hills at a little
distance,&mdash;they might, should their treasure of a sick man
recover,&mdash;and after all his money was spent, not before,&mdash;conduct
him to the nearest English military station, and be
paid all over again by the innocent white-faced Thakins
there for their kindness to their countryman.</p>

<p>So the virtuous Burman sang and laughed over his work,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in his simple <i>gaité du coeur</i>; and gathered the jungle
flowers and fruit which cost him nothing at all, but which
the Thakin would doubtless be so grateful to them for
bringing to him.</p>

<p>And Kirke lay pondering as to what course he must
pursue when he should recover.</p>

<p>In the first instance he must write to his father, confess
his sense of the sins which he had committed, and ask
pardon for his conduct.</p>

<p>But, after that, what? Would it be necessary to give
himself up to English justice, and to permit the law to take
its way with him for his attempt to lose the raft? That
would be a very bitter pill to him,&mdash;must it be swallowed?
At anyrate, moving was impossible at present, though he
was recovering fast; that question must wait, but he could
write to his father and keep the letter by him, waiting for
some chance of sending it. He would be more at peace
with himself were the confession made on paper, even were
no one ever to read it. He would feel more in earnest as
to his repentance.</p>

<p>Many days were spent over that letter, and it was a very
pathetic one when finished, for it was simple and manly in
its tone. In it he confessed his sorrow for his past life, and
his hope that he might be spared to redeem it, in some
measure, by his future career. "If I can," he wrote, "I
would wish to get something to do here, rather than return
home. I would like to prove to you that I can and will
work hard at some honest employment before asking you to
receive me into your presence again. I am recovering from
a severe attack of jungle fever, and I cannot say where I
shall go, or what I must do when I can move; but if you
forgive me, please write to the Herfords' house in Rangoon,
from whence I will endeavour to obtain letters as soon as
may be. I hope that God will give me a fresh chance;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
but if I die, will you try to believe that I am truly sorry
for the past."</p>

<p class="pmb3">He wrote and rewrote this letter, now fearing that it did
not express enough humility and contrition, then dreading
lest it should seem servile; but he completed it at last, and
laid it carefully aside.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />

<small>THE KAREN VILLAGE</small></h2>


<p>Whilst detained in the Karen village, Mr. Gilchrist and
Ralph were invited to the christening feast given by the
principal man in the place.</p>

<p>They were surprised one morning by a visit from five
young ladies, dressed in their best silk "tameins" of rich
pattern, with white muslin jackets drawn on above them,
and very gay silk handkerchiefs thrown loosely over their
shoulders.</p>

<p>They were bedizened with a quantity of jewels, roses
nestled in their splendid black hair, cheroots were in their
mouths, and each carried a handsome lacquered tray,
heaped with little parcels done up in gilt paper.</p>

<p>They advanced to the verandah, where the gentlemen
were sitting&mdash;very much to their own comfort&mdash;in free and
easy costume suitable to the intense heat. Ralph coloured
scarlet, conscious of his shirt sleeves, bare feet thrust into
slippers, and generally loosened attire; but, the girls having
come upon them suddenly, nothing could be done except a
frantic effort to button his shirt at the throat, which resulted
in dropping the stud, and seeing it maliciously roll out of
reach.</p>

<p>"Never heed them, maister," whispered Wills, who was in
attendance. "They'm used to wuss, you may take your davy.
Ef 'ee don't take no notice, they maids won't nother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>An overpowering desire to laugh took possession of the
boy at this, the more impossible to control as all the girls
advanced giggling and smiling at each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist was vexed. "Behave yourself, Ralph," said
he sternly, very anxious to maintain his dignity.</p>

<p>He rose, took off his hat with a flourish, and bowed low.
Ralph tried to imitate him; and one of the girls became
spokeswoman for the rest.</p>

<p>"My little sister's head is washed to-morrow, at sky
shutting-in time," said she. "Will the royal selfs lords
be good enough to join the feast?"</p>

<p>"We shall be pleased to do so, Mah&mdash;&mdash;?" replied Mr.
Gilchrist interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Mah Ngway Khine" (Miss Silver Spring), said she,
understanding perfectly that he meant to ask her name.
The other girls all laughed, and each gave her own name,
pointing each to her own face to indicate that this meant
herself. Miss Pretty, Miss Naughty, Miss Loveable, Miss
Beyond Compare.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist bowed to each; then, pointing to Ralph,
introduced themselves.</p>

<p>"Moung Ralph Denham,&mdash;Moung Alexander Bruce
Gilchrist."</p>

<p>The girls thought this an excellent joke, and laughed
heartily, trying to pronounce the names as hopelessly as
ever Wills himself had failed in mastering Burmese.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist then handed to each girl a cigar from
the box lying beside him, which seemed to give great
pleasure.</p>

<p>"I am going," said Miss Silver Spring, after that. "Be
pleased to eat this pickled tea," and she handed to each
one of the little packets upon her tray. The party then
went gaily off to give their invitations further.</p>

<p>"Ralph," said Mr. Gilchrist, "we must see what we can
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
find for presents to our hosts to-morrow. We had better
visit the bazaar."</p>

<p>"Lord, zur," quoth Osborn, "they du knaw the cost of
all the old trade there better nor we. They can get all
that whenever they want. Give 'em sommut what they
doan't zee every day."</p>

<p>"But what have we to give of that sort, Osborn?"</p>

<p>"English money, zur,&mdash;more particularly ef 'ee will stand
goold. English things at after. 'Ee've got tin canisters
painted up smart, haven't 'ee, with coffee and thiccee like
in 'em; and pots, with picturs a-top of the lids, with potted
meat?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist thought this good advice, he purchased
some gay silk handkerchiefs of native make in the bazaar,
a silver betel-box or two; looked out the newest sovereign
in his possession for the infant, polished it up till it glittered
finely; and then searched his stores.</p>

<p>There was not much of the ornamental among them;
nor was he willing to part with a great deal of his potted
meat; for he could buy so little animal food of other
descriptions in these country parts, where the people
objected even to selling them live poultry for their own
eating, or even eggs for them to cook.</p>

<p>The Burmese will devour raw the eggs of any creature,
fowls, turtles, crocodiles, or iguanas,&mdash;but they will cook
none.</p>

<p>A little fish was to be got at times, but in such small
quantities as to be very unsatisfying; nor was milk to be
procured, as the people neither kept cows nor used milk
themselves.</p>

<p>Our friends were growing very tired of vegetable diet,
and were obliged to trust to their own stores for everything
else.</p>

<p>However, a tin canister of coffee, decorated with gay
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
paper, was selected; and a pair of earthenware pots full
of potted meat, on one of which was a representation, in
bright colours, of Jack Sprat and his wife, sitting on either
side of a table, with the joint of roast beef on the platter
between them; while the other displayed the time-honoured
portraits of Uncle Toby and the widow.</p>

<p>Happy in the hope that pleasure was to be the meed of
these gifts, Mr. Gilchrist and Ralph dressed themselves
in clean white suits, and set off for the entertainment at
the hour specified.</p>

<p>The baby was a very small one, only about a fortnight old.
Ralph thought it looked like a little goblin changeling,
with its dark skin, lean body, and twinkling black eyes;
but it was displayed with great pride.</p>

<p>"A very&mdash;very&mdash;nice little girl," pronounced the bachelor
Scotsman, with sudden inspiration succeeding his utter
ignorance as to what he ought to say.</p>

<p>"Very like his father, ma'am," said Ralph with great
solemnity. "Has it any teeth yet?"</p>

<p>Wills, marching behind his masters, with the presents
arranged among flowers upon a tray, burst into a great
guffaw at this moment, and tried to cover his misdemeanour
by a most unnatural cough. Mr. Gilchrist looked daggers
at him over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"'Ee should have stopped at half-way, Maister Ralph,"
whispered Osborn, on the broad grin.</p>

<p>"Don't Burmese babies get teeth?" inquired Ralph
innocently. "I am sure that I have heard dozens of old
women ask my mother that question when they used to
come and see our babies at home. I thought I was all
right there."</p>

<p>"This little maid be too young, zur," said the sailor, who
had his own quiver full at home.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's it, is it?" cried Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps he had not been understood, for none of the
Burmans appeared to be surprised; but they were all much
taken up with the pride of the company of these distinguished
foreigners at their feast.</p>

<p>The father related to them that the child was born on a
Thursday, so she would prove to be of a mild, gentle
disposition; also that Thursday was the day represented
by the elephant without tusks; and he pointed to some
red and yellow waxen effigies of this animal, prepared for
offerings to be presented on his daughter's behalf upon the
steps of the nearest pagoda.</p>

<p>The astrologer, an old phoongyee, had cast the infant's
horoscope, which was a most favourable one.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist listened to all this with gravity, and then
presented their offerings, laying the bright sovereign upon
the baby's breast.</p>

<p>This evidently gave great delight; as did the packet of
choice cigars to the father, the silken kerchiefs to the
elder daughters, the betel-boxes and sweetmeats to the
sons and younger children; but something was noticeably
wrong about the jars of potted meat brought for the
mother, nor could the Englishmen understand what was
the matter.</p>

<p>That offence was taken was evident; and Mr. Gilchrist,
seeing one of the pots hurried out of sight, begged, in
much distress, to be told what he had done wrong, assuring
the head of the house that no offence was intended; he
had hoped that the English jars might, when empty, be
useful to the lady for holding betel nut.</p>

<p>After some difficulty, it appeared that Uncle Toby's
attitude, with regard to the fair widow, was not considered
proper.</p>

<p>"No Burmese gentleman would smell his wife's cheek
in public," explained the phoongyee, scandalised; but
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
willing to overlook the ignorance of foreigners who made
such handsome presents.</p>

<p>To "smell a lady's cheek" is Burmese for kissing her;
and Mr. Gilchrist, a most punctilious man in his deference
to all the fair sex, coloured highly, as he explained that
the gentleman in the picture was only removing from the
lady's eye a bit of some extraneous matter which had blown
into it.</p>

<p>This being perfectly understood, harmony was once more
established.</p>

<p>Miss Silver Spring and her sisters handed round cheroots;
all seated themselves, and began to discuss a suitable name
for the child; while the nurse washed the little one's head
in a decoction of the pods and bark of the soap acacia tree;
which was afterwards carried to each guest in turn, with
an invitation to lave his hands in the same lather.</p>

<p>Many were the names suggested for the child; some
being discarded as not beginning with the same letter of
the alphabet as that of the day of the week upon which
it had been born. Others met with disfavour from different
reasons. But at last, with an evident desire to honour Mr.
Gilchrist, and make up for the misunderstanding which
had taken place, he was entreated to propose a name&mdash;an
English name.</p>

<p>"Madam," said he, "I think there is no name
ever borne by an English lady so sweet as that of
Lily."</p>

<p>He took a beautiful lily from among the flowers heaped
on every side, and laid it in the tiny hand, which closed
upon it. All regarded this as a favourable omen,&mdash;the
child's butterfly spirit had accepted the flower, and Lily
must be her name.</p>

<p>More cheroots&mdash;more betel for chewing&mdash;more fruit&mdash;more
sweetmeats&mdash;then a grand feast&mdash;after that a pwé,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
or theatrical play. Money was given to the nurse, to the
phoongyee, and all went merry as a wedding bell.</p>

<p>Ralph soon made friends with the boys of this village,
a set of merry fellows, who taught him to play at ball in
their way, and were much impressed by his accounts of
the games played in England. He showed them how to
play at hockey, and delighted in their skittles, played with
the great flat seeds of a jungle creeper.</p>

<p>Wills instructed the blacksmith in the art of making
quoits, to the throwing of which both men and boys took
very kindly, and many a merry hour was thus passed among
them.</p>

<p>Osborn whistled melodiously, and considered himself
a dab at singing "The Death of Nelson," "The Bay of
Biscay," and other sea-songs, with which he often favoured
his new friends; and Mr. Gilchrist, who was musical, gave
them songs of a different type.</p>

<p>Ralph knew one air, and one only, which he sang for
ever, and which the Burmese boys soon caught up from
him, so that it became quite popular. It was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll hang my harp on a willow tree,<br /></span><br />
<span class="i05">I'll off to the wars again," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the Sunday evenings, Mr. Gilchrist gathered his own
party around him, and conducted the evening service, which
amazed the villagers greatly. They would gather around
the worshippers in a ring, listening, and trying to join in
when they sang the evening hymn, or "Abide with Me,"
but never interrupted the prayers.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist was particular in giving alms to the begging
monks every morning, and the phoongyee became fond
of talking to him, and asking about his religion, relating
to him pious sentences and precepts which often contained
great beauty. He, on his side, liked to hear the Englishman
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
repeat the beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer, and various
texts, which he could understand, but evidently linked on
to the sayings of the lord Guadama in some strange
fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist often wished that he possessed more
teaching power; but he was a wise man, and thought it
best to offer a little, chiefly of simple Bible words and broad
principles, which might sink in if repeated frequently,
rather than attempt what he did not feel qualified to
explain thoroughly. He likened himself to Apollos watering
the good seed extracted from the Christian's safe storehouse&mdash;the
Word of God. He would give the increase in
His own time and way.</p>

<p>So they lived for several weeks among these poor simple
people, in great harmony; collecting many rare and valuable
plants, some insects, and much experience in the language.</p>

<p>When the people learnt what was wanted, they would
go themselves into places of which they knew, sometimes
at great distances, and bring them plants; for which
liberal payment was always offered, but in many cases the
flowers were insisted upon as gifts,&mdash;expressions of goodwill.</p>

<p>After waiting for some time, and despairing at last of
finding a suitable buffalo with which to pursue their journey
farther, Mr. Gilchrist made up his mind to return to
Moulmein by the route he had come. His store of provisions
was much lessened, he had very little left, and his
gharrie was pretty well laden with jungle spoils.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Teak shingles, with orchids nailed upon them, were
fastened all round the head of the vehicle&mdash;or what the
sailors insisted upon terming "the prow." The bamboos
which supported the awning were festooned with slight
baskets, in which were planted other specimens. It was
hopeless to think of preserving their skins, feathers, or
insects from the ants and beetles without better appliances
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
than they had at command there, for all which they had
brought of carbolic soap, Keating's powder, and camphor,
was used up. So they made presents of all the tins and
jars which remained, bid their friends farewell, and set off
upon their return journey, accompanied for the first stage
by many men and boys upon forest ponies, and followed
by lamentations from a crowd of women and girls who went
no farther than the village boundary.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />

<small>THE MAN-EATER</small></h2>


<p>During the orchid hunter's stay in this village, the whole
party had improved their skill as marksmen. The difficulty
of procuring any animal food except by their own exertions,
and the excellence of the wild pea-fowl, jungle-fowl, and
deer, made Ralph, in particular, very keen after them;
and, with the delight of a boy who had never before had
the command of firearms, he missed no chance of familiarising
himself with their use.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist could give him no instruction in the art,
but old Wills knew more, and was persuaded that it was
necessary for some among the party to be fair shots, as
otherwise their lives might be in terrible danger one day
upon these wild adventurous journeys.</p>

<p>He therefore encouraged Ralph to seek sport upon every
occasion, and the lad was fast becoming practised in the art,
which pleased him much.</p>

<p>Although the village people would not kill for their own
food, they entertained no objection whatever to profit by
the peril into which, in their estimation, these strangers
brought their own salvation; and fresh meat was much
nicer than the half-rotten flesh, and that of animals which
had died of disease, upon which they would greedily feed,
and which entail upon them leprosy and other dreadful
disorders. They gratefully accepted all the Englishmen's
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
benefactions therefore, and Denham went out shooting
nearly every day.</p>

<p>The fame of the liberal-handed Englishmen, and their
absurd fancy for out-of-the-way plants from the jungle, had
spread during their stay in this village, and on the day
before Mr. Gilchrist had determined to start upon his
return to Moulmein, a man arrived from a remote hamlet,
bringing with him an orchid of such beauty and rarity as to
throw him into a state of the greatest excitement.</p>

<p>"Denham," he said, "we must secure a good supply of
this at any cost; it is a perfectly new one. To send this
home will be to secure my fame, and be the ground-work of
my fortunes. It is worth all that we have got before put
together, but the fellow has mangled it terribly in bringing
it as he has done. I must find the place where it grows,
and take the specimens properly myself, or they would
never reach England alive."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said Ralph; "I'm game."</p>

<p>They made their preparations with all possible speed,
retaining the Karen who had brought the plant for the
purpose of conducting them to the spot where it grew.</p>

<p>This man declared that it would be impossible to take
the bullock-gharrie with them under any circumstances;
the jungle tracks were too much overgrown and tangled to
admit of so large a vehicle making its way through them.
Ponies were therefore hired for the purpose, little vicious
creatures, which were used to scrambling and to the hilly
country for which they were bound. One of these carried
such equipments as Mr. Gilchrist considered necessary.</p>

<p>"I wish," said he sighing, as he added a couple of guns
to the other preparations,&mdash;"I wish that I could have foreseen,
in my youth, that I should ever be likely to find
myself wandering about in places so wild as these in which
we are now. I would have made myself a good shot in time.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
As it is, I fear, Denham, that we must trust Providence not to
let our lives depend upon the accuracy of our aim at any time."</p>

<p>"We are improving, sir," said Denham. "We cannot call
ourselves crack sportsmen, I suppose, but I don't feel as
much at sea as I used to do, and we have managed to bring
in a good deal of game lately."</p>

<p>"You and Wills have, not I," replied Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"We've got it, at anyrate," said the boy.</p>

<p>Osborn was to remain behind with the driver of the
bullock-gharrie. He did not mind being left alone among
the natives now, for he felt as if he knew them all, and was
among friends.</p>

<p>The others were soon ready to start, and pursued their
way among giant trees and matted underwood, through
marshy spots, ankle deep in water, and over stony ground
where little rivulets of water streamed among broken
rocks. The damp hollows steamed with moisture, heavy
clouds hung low over the jagged hilltops. Now they
had to cleave their way through walls of climbing plants
that cast out great tendrils, or branches; taking root in
crevices and crannies, to start afresh into luxuriant life.
Then they emerged upon some long defile where exquisite
trees were budding out into every shade of green among
dark cliffs and boulders; or upon some forest glade where
flowers of gorgeous hue clung to the trunks of palm and
peepul tree, clothing them in purple majesty, or hanging
curtains of crimson, orange, golden yellow or snowy white,
across the misty vista.</p>

<p>Birds of radiant hues flitted from bough to bough,
chattering and screaming; occasionally a deer might be
seen, or a small sambhur, standing to gaze at the intruders,
then bounding away into shady solitudes where he felt
secure.</p>

<p>Once a creature of the wild cat species was observed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
slinking along among the undergrowth; and many lizards
were feeding upon white ants and other insects in the
coarse grass.</p>

<p>They were approaching the hamlet, when, in some soft
ground near to a pool of water, their guide uttered a
horrified exclamation as he stooped to examine the pug of
some animal very freshly made in the mud.</p>

<p>"What beast's footmarks are those?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Big tiger, paya," replied the man. "He has been here
last night."</p>

<p>"Do you consider that there is any danger of our meeting
it in the jungle?"</p>

<p>"Well, paya, they wander very far sometimes in the
night, but these marks are fresh. It is not long since he
was here."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Denham, "that if we do not disturb
him, either in eating or sleeping, he would take no notice
of us? If we 'nothing say to him, he'll nothing say to
me,' eh?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, paya," said the man, "but there is no
knowing. He may be hungry, we must be very careful."</p>

<p>"Pleasant," murmured Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"All in the day's work, sir," said Ralph cheerfully.
"Hi, there!&mdash;orchids, orchids!"</p>

<p>"And the very ones we want!" cried Mr. Gilchrist, so
delighted that he forgot the tiger forthwith.</p>

<p>It was not a particularly good specimen of the orchid, but
the native said that there was plenty of it, as well as of
other varieties, in the jungle around; they would not have
to go far for them.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of what they call tiger-grass here, zur,"
said Wills; "will it be safe when we know that there is one
of those gentry near at hand?"</p>

<p>"It may be miles away now," replied Mr. Gilchrist.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
"We may have passed near to him, or to another, as we have
come through the jungle already. Don't let us die several
deaths in fearing one."</p>

<p>"Just as you please, zur," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Are the guns loaded?"</p>

<p>"Ay, zur, all right."</p>

<p>"Keep a wary lookout then; but if we were to come
across the creature, ten to one it would rather slink away
than attack us."</p>

<p>"It won't do that," said the Karen; "this is a man-eater."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Gilchrist quickly,
turning upon the native.</p>

<p>"Man-eater tiger, paya,&mdash;tiger that roams about alone,
and eats nothing but human flesh. There was one about
the village a little while ago, but we thought it had gone,
for we have not seen it lately. It has eaten five or six men
that I know of. It is an old beast, very large, very fierce,
and very cunning. Nobody can kill it."</p>

<p>This description fired Denham's ambition at once&mdash;he
longed to kill that tiger. What a feather in his cap could
he but contrive to do so! He was just about to exclaim in
his eagerness, when Mr. Gilchrist expressed an opposite
desire, so he thought it best to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall not come across it," said the more
pacific elder man. "Do your best to keep us out of its
way. How shall you know whether it is the man-eater if
we should be so unlucky as to fall across it?"</p>

<p>"Man-eater dark coloured, paya. Mangy about its head,
fur worn off in patches,&mdash;man flesh bad for him, not agree,
you know."</p>

<p>"I have heard something about that before," said Mr.
Gilchrist. "I believe that it is a question as to whether the
creature is diseased from improper food, or whether it be too
old to chase its natural prey as nimbly as would be necessary
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to secure enough, so is driven to entrap men, who are more
unwary. But, see, there is a very choice clump of the
orchids, let us set to work."</p>

<p>They were busily engaged in selecting orchids, when a
rare and beautiful butterfly came sailing along on widespread
painted wings, and Denham, who collected these
insects with ardour, gave chase. He followed it somewhat
deeper into the jungle, unheeding of the distance from his
party to which it was leading him; but Wills cast an uneasy
eye in the direction which he had taken, and presently
moved to follow him.</p>

<p>Just as he had done so, he saw the boy's light figure come
tearing back at headlong speed.</p>

<p>"The tiger! the tiger!" he cried. "It is there, it was
asleep, but lifted its head and looked towards where I was,
as I stepped among some branches. It could not see me,
for there was a big tree between us; I saw part of its back
and tail first, then hid myself and peeped. Give me a gun,
Wills, quick! Come along."</p>

<p>"Massa paya will be breakfast for tiger if he go along
like that," said the Karen. "He must climb a tree, and
watch till it pass him. Keep quiet, no get excited, keep
steady hand."</p>

<p>The man knew what he was about, it was not the first
time that he had assisted upon a similar occasion. He
selected a tree, up which Mr. Gilchrist climbed; then posted
Ralph in another at a short distance, commanding a somewhat
open glade, into which a track from the jungle led,
and passed out of it again towards a large pool of water.</p>

<p>Wills joined the Karen and the coolies, who proposed, in
two parties, to move from opposite directions round by a
detour, and try to drive the animal down this path, where
each gentleman might have a chance of shooting it from the
safe elevation of his tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>They had pistols, and moved off to right and left as
quietly as possible at first, but as soon as they had attained
to suitable positions, they began to fire into the jungle, to
utter loud cries, to throw stones among the bushes, and do
all in their power to disturb the animal, and to perplex him
as to whence the assault proceeded.</p>

<p>They did not succeed in catching any glimpse of the
beast, however; and but for Ralph's certainty that he
had seen it, would have doubted whether there had not
been some mistake. The Karen climbed a tree, which gave
him a sort of bird's-eye view of the surrounding jungle,
but if the tiger were there it was well concealed. He
descended the tree, and recommenced beating round the
circle agreed upon.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so, when one of the two coolies with
him suddenly caught hold of him, and pointed with his
long skinny arm in silent excitement.</p>

<p>A crackling of twigs might be heard, a long line of
tawny yellow colour seen gliding among the scrub, and, as
an open place intervened, a magnificent creature appeared,
half concealed as it slunk along, its head depressed till it
was in one line with its body, and its tail drooping at the
other end.</p>

<p>It walked a little lame, and presently lay down and licked
one of its paws, which seemed to be sore.</p>

<p>The beaters held their breath, and it did not seem to be
aware of their vicinity; the air, such as there was of it,
leading their scent away from them; but the other party was
drawing nearer, and the tiger evidently was more alive to
danger approaching from that side, for it lifted its head,
pricked up its ears, and listened. Then it resumed its trot
in the direction of the pool; and the beaters, allowing it to
gain a little way ahead, recommenced to drive it forwards
by every means in their power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The other party was drawing near to them, also acting on
the offensive, and the tiger increased its pace, though
evidently inconvenienced by the injury to its paw.</p>

<p>Both parties now coalesced; and, forming a wedge-shaped
cohort, followed upon the animal's track, driving it forward
by all sorts of annoyance.</p>

<p>The distance was not great, it soon reached the tree
in which Ralph was perched, eagerly looking out for it,
with his gun commanding the path upon which it was
heard crashing heavily along. The fierce, striped face, and
angry eyes, emerged from the jungle; one cruel, strong paw
protruded, the beast looked warily round, then emerged
wholly, and proceeded on its way.</p>

<p>Ralph waited till he considered his aim secure,&mdash;he
covered the creature's head, nerved his arm&mdash;fired!&mdash;and
nearly fell out of the tree from the terror induced by the
awe-inspiring, wrathful howl of pain which resounded
through the air. He had hit the tiger, certainly wounded
it, but by no means had he administered its death-blow.
It paused, staggered, and bounded forwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist fired hastily and injudiciously, missed his
aim, and the tiger abandoned its former intention of
making for the water, and, hurriedly turning to the right,
was lost sight of once more among the scrub.</p>

<p>Ralph and Mr. Gilchrist set themselves to reload their
guns with all speed; and as they did so, the beaters
came up.</p>

<p>"This is unlucky," said the Karen. "It has gone off to
the bed of a stream among the rocks, in a defile there. It
will have a den or lair among the caves there, from which
we should find it almost impossible to dislodge it; but it is
wounded certainly, and was lame before; it may stop to
drink at the stream before seeking its hiding-place. See,
here is blood, it is hard hit, let us make haste."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Only pausing to complete the reloading of their weapons,
the whole party proceeded <i>en masse</i> upon the trail. The
path was difficult, for a stream carried off the rains from a
height at a short distance, and brought stones of a considerable
size with it after a heavy downpour, emptying
itself into the large pool or lake before mentioned.</p>

<p>There was not much water in the bed of the stream yet,
but sufficient to make the stones slippery, and fill many
hollows between them with half-liquid mud. It was not
easy to proceed with caution, yet never had caution been
more desirable. Silently, slipping, scrambling, holding their
guns aloft, reaching a helping hand from one to another,
they proceeded for a couple of hundred yards; then caught
sight of the magnificent brute, extended at full length upon
its stomach beside a basin-shaped pool, lapping eagerly, yet
crimsoning the limpid water with its blood the while.</p>

<p>Ralph sprang upon a rock which commanded his prey,
fired again, hit the tiger in the neck, behind the ear, and
it rolled over, faintly kicking for a minute, then becoming
still in death.</p>

<p>They could hardly believe, at first, that the danger was
over,&mdash;Ralph himself least of all. Mr. Gilchrist fired again
at the animal as it lay, to make its death quite certain; and,
after all, approached it cautiously. It then appeared that
Ralph's first shot had taken effect in its shoulder, the bone
of which was splintered, and from the wound a quantity of
blood had flowed. But the poor creature had previously
injured its foot, in the cushion beneath which a large thorn
had become embedded, and caused a gathering, or abscess,
to form. This was the reason why it had been lame, for it
must have been very painful to tread upon it. Without this
accident it might not have been so easy a prey, for it was
a huge fellow, measuring nine feet from tip to tail.</p>

<p>Wills set himself to skin it immediately, and they camped
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
out for the night, as it was far too late to return to the
village then, but the ovation with which they were greeted
next morning was very great.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The villagers had become superstitious with regard to this
tiger, and could not sufficiently praise their deliverers.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />

<small>TATTOOING</small></h2>


<p>The spoils from this expedition now amounted to such a
quantity that it was desirable that the explorers should
return to Moulmein, and ship them off to England.</p>

<p>They had the skins of many deer, sambhurs, wild cats,
and various smaller animals, as well as those of the leopard
and tiger. There were many orchids, some beautiful butterflies,
and the skins of rare birds; curios had been picked up
in the native villages, and specimens of the ornamental
woods which grew in the forests.</p>

<p>Ralph had a famous supply of gay feathers, and other
articles, for his mother and sister; and sundry small things
which he knew would give pleasure to them and the
younger children, though he had no money wherewith to
purchase articles of much use or value.</p>

<p>Their load was more cumbersome than heavy, but it filled
up the bullock-gharrie so completely that they determined
to stop nowhere on the road. They would return as fast as
possible to Moulmein.</p>

<p>They jogged along therefore very cheerily, talking over
their adventures, and planning what they would do upon
their longer journey.</p>

<p>"How odd it seems," said Ralph, "to think that this
time last year I was only going about the town in Liverpool,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
backwards and forwards to school, and never thinking about
all the strange sights I was to see so soon. And now, it
seems as if I had always known these places. Things I
never knew of then, surprise me now no longer. This
tattooing, for instance. How queer I thought it at first, and
now I never think about it."</p>

<p>He pointed, as he spoke, to a Burman who passed them,
gorgeously tattooed.</p>

<p>"Tattooing is not uncommon among seamen in England,"
said Mr. Gilchrist. "Is it, Wills?"</p>

<p>"No, no, zur, it b'ain't. 'Tis a very useful thing too, to
hev' a mark set upon a chield so as he can be telled, dead
or alive, at any time."</p>

<p>"Ah! it be so," said Osborn. "I mind when I wor a boy
hearing tell about a young gentleman as were a midshipman
in the navy, Danby his name was. He was in a frigate,
cruising about in the South Seas; and going in command of a
boat's crew one day to get water and fruit from one of those
cannibal islands, the beggars set upon them, and murdered
them all, as 'twas said. The frigate sailed away, after revenging
the murders by a broadside poured in on the island,
and reported the whole boat's crew dead.</p>

<p>"Twenty year passed away, and the affair was nigh about
forgotten, when an English merchantman was sailing near
the same island again, and a man leaped into the water, off
a rock, and struck out, swimming for dear life towards the
ship.</p>

<p>"They lowered a boat, and took him on board.</p>

<p>"'Who be you?' asked the captain.</p>

<p>"'Charles Danby,' said he, speaking good English, for
all that he was tattooed all over his face like a native.</p>

<p>"'How did 'ee get theer?' asked the skipper.</p>

<p>"'I wor a midshipman on board His Majesty's frigate
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
<i>Achilles</i>,' saith he. 'I wor sent in command of a boat's crew
to get water, and they set upon us, and killed all but me.
One of the women took a fancy to me, and hid me. She
would have me marry her, but I didn't seem to care about
it, and stuck out so long as I could.'"</p>

<p>"Poor soul," said Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>Ralph laughed. "I'd like to see the dusky bride who
would wed <i>me</i> against my will," cried he. "She'd soon
find that she had caught a tartar."</p>

<p>"It worn't no laughing matter for <i>he</i>," said Osborn.
"They there savages, they showed him his comrades, brought
up one by one, and forced him to look on while they
murdered them, roasted them, and <i>eat</i> them. They'd ha'
served him the same but for the woman protecting him,
and she threatened him that if he wouldn't have her she'd
hand him over to the cannibals, who were always coming
to look at him, and saying what a nice tender morsel he'd
be, for he was so young and fair and rosy."</p>

<p>"I've heard of a <i>man</i>," said the incorrigible Ralph, still
laughing, "who said, when he was first married, that he was
so fond of his wife that he could have eaten her; and, afterwards,
that he often wished he had."</p>

<p>"You go along, Maister Ralph," quoth old Wills.
"What should a babe, the likes of you, know about such
things."</p>

<p>Ralph made a face at his old friend, and begged Osborn
to tell him the end of the midshipman.</p>

<p>"Well, 'ee doan't deserve as I should," said Osborn;
"but, howsomever, the boy gave in. He wor but a babe
hisself,&mdash;only fourteen,&mdash;and life was sweet to him even at
that cost; so he took the woman, and tried to do his best
with her, though it was sorry work. They tattooed him
all over, face and all, to make him look as like themselves
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
as they could; and he wore no clothes, but lived just like
them. He got to do so exactly like them that he could
pick up a fishhook from the ground with his toes, just
like they could; and he had some children, and was looked
upon in time just like the rest.</p>

<p>"He lived twenty years like this, and never saw a British
ship, nor a white face, nor a sign of home all that time, for
the island was an out-of-the-way one. Then, one day, all
to once he saw that there merchantman in the offing. He
wor a-fishing by himself, and he watched the vessel sailing
nearer and nearer, old half-forgotten thoughts of home, and
friends, and old England, cropping up clearer and clearer
every minute; and with them a yearning for them, tearing
at his heart like, till he could bear it no longer. He just
jumped into the sea, and swam off to the ship.</p>

<p>"The poor fellow was so afraid of being caught and
claimed again by his family in the island, that the skipper
changed his tack, and sailed away from it, so he was brought
home in safety.</p>

<p>"Then came the difficulty of proving himself to be Charles
Danby, for nobody could recognise him. He'd left home
a rosy-faced, curly-haired lad of thirteen; he came back
looking like a South-Sea islander of thirty-four.</p>

<p>"His father was dead, but his mother was still living,
and she did not know him all to once, nor none of his
friends.</p>

<p>"But it wor no such tale as Tichborne's. He remembered
all sorts of things that none but he could know,&mdash;people's
names, old jokes, old stories, people in the village dead
and gone, things that had happened at school.</p>

<p>"It was for ever, 'Where is the old cabinet that did stand
here?' 'What has become of the gamekeeper's boy, Jack?'
and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"He soon satisfied his mother, his old nurse, and such
like; but there was some money to come to him, and it
was necessary to prove to the law that he was the right
man to have it, and that was a harder matter.</p>

<p>"'Had he no mark upon him?' asked the lawyer of his
mother.</p>

<p>"'Ay,' said she, 'he had a small mole on his cheek.'</p>

<p>"But that was either gone, or covered up with the
tattooing, and could not be seen, nor could they think of
anything else.</p>

<p>"'I was tattooed C. D. on my right arm,' saith he,
'first time I went to sea. C. D. it were, and the Union
Jack, but it wore out. The natives didn't tattoo my
arm there, because it wor done already, but it has
not lasted like their marks have done. See, here is the
bare spot.'</p>

<p>"Sure enough, there was a bare round place among the
marks on his arm, but no flag nor letters wor to be seen.
He hunted up the very shipmate as had done it, and who
swore to having done it, and showed the fellow-mark on
his own arm, only with the letters different, for each had
taken the initials of his own name, though the pattern they
said was the same in both.</p>

<p>"'Ay!' saith Mr. Danby, 'I mind what an arm I gave
you, and how you swore at me for going so deep. You
mocked at me for holloing out while you did me, and I
vowed I'd make you holloa too.'</p>

<p>"'So 'ee did,' said the other officer. 'What did 'ee do
it with?'</p>

<p>"'With three big darning-needles out from a red-leather
huswife that my poor dear sister Mary gave me for a keep-sake
when I went away. It had a looking-glass in it, and
little blue flowers worked inside. She told me to mend
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
my stockings when I was at sea, but it's not many stockings
as I've worn.'</p>

<p>"'I have the huswife now,' said his mother; 'it came
back among his things. Many a time did poor Mary cry
over it before she died. She used to say, "He minded what
I told him about his stockings, mother, for the darning
needles are gone."'</p>

<p>"'We lashed them together, threaded through the eyes
with a bit of wire,' said Mr. Danby.</p>

<p>"'So we did,' said his friend.</p>

<p>"Well, this was all very good, but the marks wor gone,
you see, so no proof in law. Just then the doctor came
in, and 'What are you saying?' asked he. So they told
him.</p>

<p>"'Show me your arm,' said he; and Danby put it out.</p>

<p>"The doctor took and rubbed it hard, till it wor red as
a lobster.</p>

<p>"'Hold hard, doctor! you'll rub down to the bone.'</p>

<p>"But the doctor knew what he was doing, and when the
place was well scrubbed, 'What do 'ee call <i>that</i>?' saith
he, pointing for the lawyer to see.</p>

<p>"There was, quite plain, the Jack and C. D., inside a circle
of little dots, all in white marks upon the reddened skin.
It was exactly like the blue marks upon the other man's
arm, except for the initials being different, but hadn't
been done so deep, so the gunpowder had worn out by
degrees.</p>

<p>"They gave him his money, but he didn't live long to
enjoy it. He was quite unfitted to live like a Christian
after so many years of savage life, and civilisation killed
him."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," sighed Mr. Gilchrist; "it is a strange
story."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Wills then began to relate some of his reminiscences.
He never liked to be out-done by Osborn.</p>

<p>"Two or three voyages ago," said he, "we had a black
cook on board; and when we were at the office, being
shipped, some talk went on about tattooing. One of the
young gentlemen was entering our names in the ship's
register, and a sailor was showing his arms and chest the
while. He was beautifully tattooed with red and blue
both. He had the royal arms on his chest, and a girl,
skipping, with a wreath of flowers round her; and his
arms were all over letters and anchors and crosses, and
what not.</p>

<p>"'Is any other of you so grand as this?' asked the
young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Two or three had marks, but none so good, and he turned
to the nigger.</p>

<p>"'You don't need mark of mouth, Sambo, I suppose?'
said he.</p>

<p>"'Me marked though, massa,' said the darkie, grinning
from ear to ear,&mdash;'me marked. Me fall in fire when boy,
and the mark of burn never gone. Scored, massa, me was,&mdash;branded
by hot bar. Golly! it were bad.'</p>

<p>"And he rolled up his sleeve, and showed the scars of a
terrible burn.</p>

<p>"Well, we sailed in bad weather, and met with an awful
storm two days after. The ship was pooped, the name-board
washed away, and much damage done. We managed
to put it to rights though, and went on our way; but others
were less lucky. It was off the coast of Wicklow, and in
that same storm, another ship went down with all hands;
and some of the drowned men were washed up among the
wreckage, <i>and our name-board</i>, with '<i>Osprey</i>, Liverpool'
painted on it quite plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course the word reached 'Herfords' that it was we
that was lost, but the rig of some of the spars washed up,
and the colour of the paint, did not agree. One of the
dead seamen was a negro, but another of them was reported
to have had two fingers of his left hand gone at some
former time; and though there was a negro among us, and
both were reported fine, tall, big fellows, we had none
among our jack-tars maimed in the hand.</p>

<p>"So the young gentleman that shipped the crew was sent
over, with Lloyd's agent, to the Wicklow coast, to see if
he could identify the corpses. Some two or three days
had passed, while letters had been written backwards and
forwards, and as the poor fellows had been sadly knocked
about among the wreckage, there was no chance of recognising
them, and they'd all been buried before the young
clerk came.</p>

<p>"'Tis a pity as it's so,' said he, talking to Lloyd's man.
'If he were not underground, I'd have known the negro,
because he had the big scar from an old burn on the inside
of his left arm, reaching nearly from his elbow to his wrist.'</p>

<p>"'Say you so,' said Lloyd's agent, 'then we'll have him
dug up again.'</p>

<p>"The young gentleman did not half like that, but it was
done, and he had to be there, with result that the dead
negro had no mark at all on his arm, so could not be the
same man.</p>

<p>"Captain Rogers was chief mate on that voyage; and your
ma, zur, was prettily relieved when she heard this, for it
was a long time before we was able to report ourselves.
News did not fly so soon in thiccee times as now."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ralph, "the outcome of all this is that
I had better get tattooed as soon as I can. Will you do
it for me, Wills?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better wait till 'ee du get to Rangoon, maister, for
'twill make your arm very sore for some days."</p>

<p>"No, no, Denham; don't be foolish," said Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Ralph laughed, and the party stopped for their mid-day
meal, which changed the conversation.</p>


<p class="break" />
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>


<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />

<small>THE OLD MEN'S FAITH</small></h2>


<p>The journey back to Moulmein offered no further adventures
worthy of mention; and, when arrived there, Mr. Gilchrist
remained in that place quietly until after the New Year.</p>

<p>The floods had then subsided, and the articles for which
he had sent to England arrived.</p>

<p>He sent off to Mr. Herford all that he had collected
during his first expedition; and received advices from
Rangoon, with money, and full credentials for making
every possible preparation whilst he was waiting.</p>

<p>Ralph and the two Cornish seamen were regularly
engaged, at liberal salaries; and Captain Rogers wrote to
his nephew of the situation reserved for him in the Rangoon
house of business,&mdash;a situation which, if he were assiduous
and steady, would assure his fortune for life, and enable
him to forward the interests of his younger brothers.</p>

<p>Ralph also received letters from home, and from Kershaw,
relating how kindly he had been received by Mrs. Denham.
He mentioned his determination to pass for his master's
certificate before again going to sea; and assured his friend
that he would often call upon his mother and sister, to tell
them all particulars about Ralph himself, which he might
omit when writing.</p>

<p>"I daresay he will," thought Ralph; "and a pretty farrago
of rubbish they will hear from him, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Letters arriving faster than the heavy goods that were
sent round the Cape, one from Mrs. Denham, giving the
account of the mate's second visit, reached Ralph before
he again left Moulmein.</p>

<p>"Your good-looking young friend, Mr. Kershaw, called
again last night," she wrote, "and was most amusing. I
do not think I have laughed for many years more than I
did to hear him relating your imaginary love-affair with a
Burmese belle. With the gravest face, and pretended
sympathy for us, he went on piling up the agony, while
Agnes believed every word, and her big blue eyes dilated
with horror. 'She is a very charming thing in natives,
from a Shan district,' he said, with a sly glance at her;
'she is dressed chiefly with a tablecloth and a rose; she
carries a green cheroot in her ear, and she and Denham
smoke it by turns. She sells Burmese cats in the bazaar,
and has a fascinating way of sitting upon her heels, which
leaves nothing to be desired as to grace. She will be able
to teach you much in the way of cooking, Miss Denham;
this cake, which I understand is made by yourself from a
Cornish receipt, is delicious to <i>me</i>, but Denham has quite
taken to Burmese ways now. You should see him devouring
rotten fish. He is very partial to it, with rice; and
finishes his light and wholesome meal with Chinese patties
made of sugar and fat pork.'</p>

<p>"'Mr. Kershaw!' she cried. She could really say no
more, her horror was so great.</p>

<p>"He turned to her with the kindest air. 'It is sad, Miss
Denham, is it not? Your dear brother seemed made for
better things; but, after all, an early attachment is often
the saving of a man. I think that I could draw a sketch
of the lady if you would favour me with a pencil.' Then
he drew the most awful-looking picture which you could
imagine; and Agnes watched every line with her whole
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
soul in her face, and heaved the deepest sigh when it was
finished. 'It is a pretty face, is it not?' asked he politely.
'Perhaps I have favoured her a little, she may not be quite
so sweet-looking in reality, but she really is a charming
girl.'</p>

<p>"He has just walked in again, and brought Agnes the
present of what he calls a Burmese cat, and declares that
your <i>fiancée</i> sold it to him for twopence three farthings,
and a dish of fried maggots. It is a thing upon wires, or
joints of some kind, like a perfect demon, sprawling and
jerking about, and has already frightened baby nearly into
a fit."</p>

<p>"I would like to punch his head for him," soliloquised
Ralph. "What an idiot he is!"</p>

<p>But this is somewhat out of place.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist was not desirous of remaining long in Moulmein
after his stores had arrived from England. The sooner
he started, the cooler would be the weather, and the more
time there would be for his journey before the rains set in.</p>

<p>Their friends, however, would not part with them until
they had passed Christmas in company; and Ralph was a
little disappointed to find that the merry water-festival was
not to take place upon the English New Year's Day, but on
that sacred to Burma. He found that this day fell about
the beginning of April, so he must wait to see the images
washed, and to share in the sport of throwing water at
everyone, until that time, when he would probably have
arrived in Rangoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist knew that many orchids could not be found
in bloom before February; but, as the jungles around
Moulmein had been pretty well investigated, he wished to
reach fresh fields and pastures new by that time; and
travelling was slow work in Burma, where the people
resolutely refuse to proceed on their way if they consider
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the day unlucky,&mdash;if a snake cross their path at the outset
of their journey,&mdash;or if the white witch of any district, who
is always consulted <i>en passant</i>, pronounce that the nats are
adverse.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the chances for this new expedition
were considered to be favourable, as a very fortunate day
was selected in the first instance, and the scouts of the
party lighted upon a magnificent bed of mushrooms before
the sun was well up.</p>

<p>With great delight they collected a goodly supply of this
delicacy; Mr. Gilchrist produced a tin of gravy soup in
which to stew them, and they feasted upon them for
breakfast. Even the Englishmen were cheered by the
satisfaction apparent on the faces of their attendants at
this favorable omen.</p>

<p>"Well," said Wills, "ef it be an omen, 'tis no manner of
use to set oneself up against 'un. 'Tis well az it be a good
'un, for there be a pesky lot more of whisht 'uns than of
'tother zooart."</p>

<p>"Ah! there be," said Osborn; "and of spreets too."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a spirit, Osborn?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"I did, my son," said Osborn.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it," pleaded the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, it wor when I was a young shaver, nineteen or
twenty, or theerabout, to age; and I'd gone down St. Minver
way to stay with my old granfer, who lived in thiccee
parish. There wor an awful storm came, fust week in
December, and the breakers were mountain high against the
cliffs. Word went az how a big three-masted ship of foreign
rig had been zeen trying to make for Padstow Harbour
when night came, but never a stick of it wor zeen again.
'Twor supposed az it ran on the Doom Bar theer, at mouth
of the harbour. I must needs go down to Hell Bay, az they
do call 'un, next day, to zee the waves, az was foaming out
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
for miles; and a fine sight it wor, though the tide had
turned, and wor roaring out then. I walked along the
head of the cliff so az to get out amongst 'em; and az
I went, I zeed an old man, with a long grizzled beard
and moustache, like a forriner, a-leaning hisself against a
stile.</p>

<p>"'Good-marnin', zur,' saith I; but he only turned his great
sorrowful eyes upon me, with dark fire blazing out of 'em,
and never spoke a word.</p>

<p>"'You'm an unmannerly chield,' thought I to myself, but
I made to pass him without no more to zay. But he stood
in my road, and lifted his hand, and beckoned, like a chield
az was used to be obeyed.</p>

<p>"Then I did zee as how his hair was wet, dripping with
watter down over his cloathes, and zayweed and little crabs
stuck to it, and his hands and face wor all battered and
bruised and torn, and he wor soaked through and through
with watter. He moved on, making signs for me to follow
of 'un, and the watter squelched in his shoes az he went,
and I didn't dare to hang back.</p>

<p>"He led me out right to point of the cliff, and down over
the rocks to a little cove behind, where a great broken
mass reared up in front of a cavern, and theer, a-lyin' on
the strip of sand, beside the great pool of watter, lay a
lady, and she had a little child held tight in her arms,
with its face cuddled down on her neck, as ef 'twor asleep.
When he pointed to thiccee, he gave a dreadful great wailing
cry, and wor gone.</p>

<p>"I thought the lady was alive at first; for the wind lifted
up her long black hair, az ef 'twor playing with it; and
for all that her white gown were torn, and a great rag of
lace fluttered from it, it wor decently folded round her, but
she wor dead and cold enough when I come to touch her.</p>

<p>"I got help, and she wor carried round, and buried up in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the churchyard, with her little 'un in the same coffin, but
neither I nor any living chield ever saw the forriner more."</p>

<p>"Osborn!" cried Ralph. "Do you really mean to tell
me that you saw that yourself?"</p>

<p>"I did, Maister Ralph."</p>

<p>"That Hell Bay be a quare place, zur," said Wills. "I
du knaw she well. Ef there du be sech things az spreets,
thiccee be the spot for 'un. Many and many a good ship
have gone to pieces there; never a winter passes but three
or four du go. I mind me of one awful gale when a big
ship were seen there, throwing up lights and firing guns
for help, but no help could drae near to 'un. Next day
one little baby's shoe wor washed up,&mdash;a purty little blue
kid shoe, with a silver button to it, but never a sign more
of who or what the volks might be that had all gone in the
dead hours of the night."</p>

<p>"Ay," began Osborn, once more resuming his reminiscences.
"That wor the gale&mdash;I mind it well&mdash;when
a brig rode safely into Padstow Harbour, and wor saved,
with never a living soul aboard of her. The crew had been
scared, and took to their boats, when ef they'd stuck to
the brig they'd have been saved. Never a one wor zeed,
but the clock were ticking away when the brig was boarded,
a-telling the time for the dead men; and the fried bacon
and tetties wor a-keeping hot over the galley fire for them
az would never eat a meal more."</p>

<p>"Don't you think of these things when a storm comes
while you are at sea?" asked Ralph. "Do they not make
you nervous?"</p>

<p>"No, maister, I dunna knaw az it du. Men must die
sometime, and the Lord's will must be followed. He du be
so near to uz on zea az on land."</p>

<p>Ralph was silent, but he thought much. The old men's
simple trust in their God struck him forcibly in all its truth
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and beauty. It was not ignorance of the risks which they
ran, it was not heedlessness, it was not fatalism,&mdash;it was
faith. Were he called upon to face death&mdash;instantaneous
death&mdash;while life was still strong and lusty within him,
could he meet it in the same steady spirit?</p>

<p>He feared not. Then he remembered a passage in the
Bible, where men persecuted were counselled not to
perplex themselves by wondering what they should say in
hypothetical circumstances, for it should be given to them,
in that same hour, what they should say. Perhaps it would
also be given to others what they should do. He prayed
inwardly that it might be so. Life was teaching this lad
many lessons, though unconsciously to himself.</p>

<p>Also the simple straightforwardness with which he was
performing his duty, under such untoward claims upon it,
was influencing those whom he loved, at home, in a manner
of which he little thought.</p>

<p>He had gone out to Burma, because he wished to relieve
his mother of his keep, and this was the only manner in
which he saw the possibility of so doing at once. He had
thus been the means of introducing into his mother's household
a lady who proved to be a most valued and valuable
friend to the whole family.</p>

<p>By his conduct during the voyage, he had secured the
attachment of several important friends for himself; opened
for himself excellent prospects for prosperity in life; and
earned the advantages of seeing a new country in a manner
which few succeed in doing even after long residence in it.
This, in after years, proved to be of material service to his
career.</p>

<p>The accounts of his heroism in the fire at sea, and the
esteem for his character which that aroused, called out all
that was best in his brother's heart; and made the favourable
turning-point in his life at a critical and dangerous age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, this same heroism induced Mr. Herford to take
great notice of his mother and the whole family. He
befriended them in many ways,&mdash;assisting in the children's
education, securing for them many cheerful pleasures, and
making them valuable presents from time to time.</p>

<p>None of these advantages would have accrued to himself,
or to those he loved, had Ralph been idle, selfish, or
neglectful of his duty; but now he was destined to go
through a yet greater trial of endurance than any before.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Little did he think, when he set out so gaily upon his
second expedition, of all the dangers which were about to
beset his path while pursuing it.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />

<small>BIG GAME</small></h2>


<p>When the New Year had come, all preparations being
satisfactorily completed, our friends set forth upon their
second journey; feeling themselves so much better equipped,
and so much more experienced in both travelling, and
speaking the necessary languages, that they started in the
highest spirits.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist enforced various strict regulations, with
regard to the safety of his party.</p>

<p>None were to wander alone, far from the rest; none to
start off upon independent explorations; all were to carry
upon their persons, at all times, suitable firearms, always
ready for use; ample supply of charges for them; hunting-knives
in good order; and a small supply of food, in case of
accident.</p>

<p>Native villages were plentifully scattered upon their
road,&mdash;English stations not unfrequent. The weather was agreeable,
and all promised well.</p>

<p>The party was successful in finding many rare orchids; so
that, though their progress was slow, they were content.</p>

<p>They did not cross the river Salween, preferring to
proceed along its banks northwards, and to search the
rocky country upon its eastern side for some distance first,
as the plants seemed to be of a different character there
from those which they had already collected; and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
cessation of traffic upon the river, in consequence of the
frequent rapids in it, rendered a passage across it difficult.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist perceived that, from the solitary character
of this district, it was one in which they might possibly
meet with danger from wild beasts; but he thought it
unlikely that any such creatures would attack so large a
number of people, or could not easily be beaten off if they did.</p>

<p>At first the whole party was wary; but, seeing no big
game, they became less apprehensive of danger.</p>

<p>Many peacocks and other birds were met with, and Ralph
became quite an adept in shooting them. Their flesh made
a welcome variety in the commissariat department.</p>

<p>One day his gun was heard popping at a short distance;
and Wills began to prepare a peeled wand, to serve as spit
upon which to roast the expected treat, when the lad burst
through the bushes in great excitement, his blue eyes
blazing from his sunburnt, flushed face, beneath his dark
waves of hair.</p>

<p>"Come quickly!" he shouted. "Come at once! Here is
a whole herd of elephants crossing the river! Such a
sight!"</p>

<p>All hurried after him. It was a fine sight. There must
have been twenty or thirty elephants, with their trunks
uplifted in air, swimming across where the water was
tolerably quiet and still. One old female had a baby
elephant with her, and encouraged the little one as she
went with sounds that the young one might consider words
of advice or caution.</p>

<p>"Oh, see, see!" cried Ralph. "There are more young
ones, but bigger. How carefully the old ones guard them.
I wonder why they are going across! I am glad they are
not coming this way."</p>

<p>"They go over to feed on big tree, paya," said one of the
Burmese. "Elephant like juicy branches of trees like those."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>In effect, the whole herd began to feed at once upon
reaching the farther shore. They could reach the tender
boughs at the tops of the largest trees by stretching their
trunks. They tore them down, and ate them with vast
relish.</p>

<p>None of the Englishmen had ever before seen wild
elephants in a natural state, and were deeply interested in
watching them.</p>

<p>Suddenly a terrible noise was heard approaching them
from behind; an angry, surly "Hunf, Hunf," which struck
terror into their hearts, even before they saw a huge
infuriated elephant coming, crashing and tearing its sullen
way through the undergrowth.</p>

<p>"Fly! fly!" cried Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"Ameh! ameh!" shrieked the Burmans.</p>

<p>"Lord defend us!" exclaimed Osborn.</p>

<p>"Maister Ralph, Maister Ralph! Thee'rt just in his
road!" vociferated Wills. The old man rushed forward and
fired at the monstrous creature.</p>

<p>The elephant turned and charged down upon his assailant.</p>

<p>"Run, run; I'm all right!" he cried. "Run, my son,
run!"</p>

<p>Ralph fled. He was standing a little apart from the
rest, and escaped up a gulley or defile among the rocks, in
a different direction from that taken by the others. They
made for a group of rocks a little separated from the range
among which they were orchid hunting; a few trees grew in
a clump hard by. Wills alone was left at the mercy of the
raging creature.</p>

<p>The trees formed his only chance of shelter, and he
doubled, flying back towards them. Panting, labouring for
breath, he just reached the tiny grove, and concealed himself
behind a mighty bole. Hidden from immediate view
there, he slipped backwards, and doubled again behind
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
another, just as the elephant, with a tramp that shook the
earth beneath him, ran full tilt at the first tree, set his
shoulder against it, and levelled it to the ground.</p>

<p>At the same moment, above the crashing and rending of
timber, the splitting of branches, and the trumpeting of the
mad brute, came the clear ping! ping! of two rifles, as Mr.
Gilchrist and Osborn both took aim, and hit the creature in
the shoulder. Wills fired, at the same moment, from
behind his shelter upon the other side, and a trickle of red
blood upon the elephant's flapping ear bore witness to the
justness of his aim.</p>

<p>In the next moment, Gilchrist's and Osborn's second
barrels rang out; and a volley of small shot from the rest of
the party peppered the great mass, which, at such near
quarters, it would have been difficult to miss.</p>

<p>It seemed to be too hot a place for the intruder. With an
awful cry of anger and pain it shambled heavily to the
river's bank, plunged into the stream, and swam down it.</p>

<p>The distant echo of a gun was heard at the same moment,
up the defile, but no one attended to it, for the form of old
Wills was seen to sway, to totter, and to sink upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Had he been injured? Had he trod upon a snake?
Had some other poisonous reptile or insect attacked him?
His friends, in the greatest anxiety, hurried up to him,
raised his prostrate figure, and found him in a deep swoon.</p>

<p>Osborn ran for water; Mr. Gilchrist supported him in his
arms, and called to the chief coolie to fetch his brandy flask.</p>

<p>The Burman implored the master not to arouse the insensible
man until his "butterfly spirit" returned to its
mortal prison-house, but no heed was paid to him; and
presently Wills opened his eyes, with a bewildered expression,
and looked around.</p>

<p>"Where is the boy?" he asked. "Is the boy safe?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>No one could answer him, for Denham was not there.
What had become of him?</p>

<p>It was no time for seeking him then, however; none of
the men supposed that he was very far off, or in further
danger now that the solitary elephant had gone down the
river.</p>

<p>"He is all right," said Mr. Gilchrist soothingly. "He'll
be here in a minute. Let us take you back to the bullock-gharrie,
you must lie down in the shade."</p>

<p>Wills offered no resistance, but he could not stand; he
was trembling from head to foot. The men constructed a
hasty litter with their rifles, some branches, and grass; they
laid Wills upon it, and carried him back to the spot where
their gharrie was in waiting for them.</p>

<p>Though certainly clear-headed, and quite himself for a
few minutes after he first came out of his swoon, a confusion
seemed to overpower his mind again, and his speech was not
distinct. Mr. Gilchrist felt very uneasy, as he feared that
the sudden shock had induced some form of a stroke; and he
knew himself wholly unfit to deal with a matter so serious.</p>

<p>He called up the Burman, and asked him where the
nearest doctor was likely to live.</p>

<p>"At English station, paya," replied the man; "one only
half-day's journey, or a little more, from here. The royal
self's lord may reach it by sky shutting-in time, if make
haste."</p>

<p>"Is there an English doctor there?"</p>

<p>"Good doctor, paya; half-caste,&mdash;wise man."</p>

<p>There seemed nothing to do but to take Wills on to this
station without loss of time, and Mr. Gilchrist gave orders
to prepare.</p>

<p>The day was now far advanced, no more time ought to be
lost; but it suddenly occurred to them all that Ralph was
not with them. What had become of the boy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>He had been seen flying from the elephant up the defile,
as Wills had turned the charge of the mad creature upon
himself. Some of them remembered now that the discharge
of a gun had been heard afterwards up this defile; but why
had the boy not returned?</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist sent the chief Burman and some coolies to
search for him. Osborn would not leave his friend, over
whom either sleep or stupor seemed to be creeping.
Gilchrist himself went, with the rest of the men in another
direction, ascending a hill which promised to afford a view
up that defile; but nothing could be seen from the thickness
of the jungle below.</p>

<p>They shouted, called, fired off blank cartridge,&mdash;but no
response came. Slowly, and much perplexed, they returned
to the gharrie, to find Wills growing rapidly worse. The
search party came back with no news. Not a trace of the
lad could they discover; but they brought in two young
tiger cubs, that they had found lying asleep, to all appearance
alone.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that two such very young cubs
could have been there, and their mother be far away; but
though there was evidently a lair there, no vestige of the
parent animal was to be seen. The certainty of such
creatures being in the neighbourhood, however, hastened
the men's return. They had killed the cubs with their
hunting-knives, lest the sound of guns should have brought
down the female tiger upon them, and then they had
hurried back, as fast as possible, from desire to secure their
own safety.</p>

<p>Had Ralph fallen a victim to these creatures? Was the
absence of the mother from her cubs due to the destruction
of the poor young fellow? Mr. Gilchrist shuddered, as he
recognised the probability of this explanation.</p>

<p>But one shot had been heard, and no further sound,&mdash;no
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
cry for help, no call, no other report of firearms. What
could this mean except one thing?</p>

<p>And what must he do now? Was it of any use to wait,
to search further for Ralph? To save Wills they must
push on to the English station. It would be best to do so,
and return to search for the boy.</p>

<p>There could be little doubt but what he had fallen a
victim to the tigress; but at least some evidence to this
effect might be found,&mdash;his gun, some portion of his clothing,
at least, might be there.</p>

<p>If he had escaped, he could have come back. He had
ammunition with him, though it might not be much, for he
had shot a good supply of birds that day. He had some
biscuits with him. Finally, Mr. Gilchrist ordered a little
tent to be pitched for him, a large fire to be built up,
which would serve to mark the place from a distance,
and would identify it to himself when he returned to it.
He wrote a few lines upon a piece of paper, affixing it
to the tent-pole, to desire Ralph to wait there until he
came back to join him, which should be done as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>He would have left some of the men there, but the
near neighbourhood of tigers had terrified them out of all
discipline, and every one of them utterly refused to remain
unless the royal lord stayed himself to protect them.
There was no help for it, therefore; and the party set forth
with sad and anxious hearts; the day being so far spent as
to place themselves in some peril from the possible attack
of wild beasts, coming down from their rocky fastnesses to
drink at the river.</p>

<p>They had to keep near the banks of the stream, too; for
the road was more open there, and they could not take the
bullock-gharrie through narrow or tangled paths. As it
was, poor Wills was terribly jolted very often, but remained
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
in a state of semi-consciousness, wandering in his mind
when aroused.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mr. Gilchrist walked, to leave more room for Osborn to
tend his friend; but he kept near the head of the gharrie,
where he could hear and see all that went on in it. The
attendants surrounded or followed, bearing flaring torches
after the darkness fell, and the anxious hours passed on.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />

<small>THE JUNGLE FIRE</small></h2>


<p>Mr. Gilchrist supposed that they might be drawing near
the English settlement, which he found, upon conversation
with the chief Burman, to be a police-station; when on the
farther side of a small tributary to the river, which it would
be necessary to ford, a bright glare of light flashed upon
them suddenly as they rounded a spur of rock.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked he anxiously.</p>

<p>"Paya, it is the jungle on fire," said the man. "It is the
first jungle fire I have heard of this year, but it happens
frequently in the heat every season."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the gentleman, "what a sight!
Are we safe here?"</p>

<p>"From the fire? yes, certainly," said the Burman. "See,
my royal lord, there is a strip of clear ground on the farther
bank of the stream, and the water would quench anything
that is likely to reach it. But form up closely,
for wild beasts may burst through here, being accustomed
to drink at this place, and cross the ford where it is
shallow."</p>

<p>"Load the guns," cried Mr. Gilchrist "Close round the
gharrie; take out the bullocks, and fasten them to the
wheels,&mdash;we can surround them better so. Set your backs
to the cart, and keep your weapons ready."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>He would have had Osborn remain in the gharrie,
beneath shelter, with Wills, but the old man was out at the
first hint of danger. He laid his friend's head upon a
cushion, renewed the wet rags that lay upon his fevered
brow, gave him some cool drink, and was ready to help his
master in five minutes.</p>

<p>He was needed. Gilchrist looked round, his numbers were
short. Had the uncertain light deceived him? Surely
there should have been enough men to surround the gharrie
and bullocks; also the two tats, or ponies, and the larger
horse, that were now brought into such close space, and
fastened to the cart. He counted heads. Three Burmans
were missing.</p>

<p>A very short search discovered them,&mdash;they were
crouched upon the ground, beneath the gharrie, hiding, in
an agony of fear.</p>

<p>"Come out, you cowardly rascals!" thundered he.
"Come out, or I will shoot you all as you lie there! Come
out this instant!"</p>

<p>The men crept out, shaking with fright, and imploring
the royal lord's self to pardon them. They did not know
whether to be most afraid of him, or the fire, or the possible
wild beasts. They were not likely to be of much use
whichever danger arose first.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist posted them between the coolies, Osborn,
and himself, with orders that the first one who abandoned
his post should be shot without mercy.</p>

<p>Meantime, animals were flying by, now by one or two at a
time, then in herds. Sambhurs, with terrified eyes, bounded
along at headlong speed; peacocks flew past, screaming;
water-fowl rose in air. Monkeys jabbered and leapt by,
wild cats scurried across. Then a great roar was heard,
and a pair of leopards sprang out of their covers, and stood
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
glaring at the little band, every hair upon their beautiful
spotted skins seeming to bristle with wrath.</p>

<p>Out rang Mr. Gilchrist's rifle; out rang Osborn's,&mdash;the
female fell; the male, hardly braver than the Burmans,
though more ferocious, turned tail and fled. The leopard
was not dead, her leg was broken by one shot, her side
entered by the other; but the contents of the second
barrels despatched her.</p>

<p>Hardly had she been dead ten minutes, when, with a heavy
flapping of dark wings, many vultures were seen sweeping
past and settling upon the nearest trees. The branches
were weighed down with the black mass of these ill-omened
birds.</p>

<p>Meantime the fire wound along among the jungle-grass
in brilliantly sinuous lines; and ever as it ran hither and
thither, a screaming, fluttering, shrieking rush of animal
life followed it, though not always taking the direction of
our friends.</p>

<p>After the first, though clouds of birds and bats flew over
their heads, deer, and larger beasts, hurrying to places of
safety, turned aside upon perceiving them, and scampered
farther down the stream. Rats and small fry ran in the
shallow water along its banks; and monkeys swung themselves,
hand over hand, among the trees.</p>

<p>By degrees the fire burnt itself out upon their road, and
swept farther away; but it was broad daylight before the
travellers dared to relax their vigilance, or breathe freely
once more. Mr. Gilchrist served out a modicum of brandy
to each man, and some biscuits. The refreshment was much
needed, and gave them heart.</p>

<p>In the cool early morning, Wills was better; his temperature
went down, his mind appeared clearer, and his
speech less confused. Then, too, rising above the blackened
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
jungle, perched high upon a hillside, appeared the police-station;
and a group of horsemen might be seen, in fresh
linen garments, riding down in their direction. A lady was
one of the party as well; she cantered along in her easy
grey habit, with long curls blowing back beneath a shady
black hat, a pleasant sight to all. She proved to be a
girl of nineteen, just come out from home, the bride of the
young police officer; a bonnie, slender thing, with smiling
lips, frank blue eyes, English roses still upon her cheeks,
Burmese roses fastened into the bosom of her jacket.</p>

<p>So short a time had elapsed since her marriage, that she
still gave a little involuntary start of remembrance when
anyone called her Mrs. Brudenel, the name which she had
been accustomed to hear only as that of her husband's
mother, while at his "wifey," a flush of colour would suddenly
mantle upon her fair young face.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist had his own private hopes, which caused
him to watch these little signs with secret interest, though
he betrayed no outward symptom of his pleasure in them,
and maintained a formal show of deep respect towards
her.</p>

<p>She was kindness itself to poor Wills, and treated him
with a skill which showed her familiarity with illness. No
sooner did she receive him into her house, than she directed
her ayah to prepare her one spare room for him,&mdash;a cool
pleasant apartment; she bathed his brow with a fragrant
lotion, applied mustard poultices to the back of his head
behind his ears; she supplied all other things desirable,
and devised means for throwing out a profuse perspiration
upon his body.</p>

<p>Wills gradually recovered his full senses under this treatment,
but was very weak.</p>

<p>The doctor soon arrived, and so played his skilful part,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
that, upon bringing to him a basin of such soup as he had
seldom enjoyed, Wills looked up anxiously in Mrs. Brudenel's
face.</p>

<p>"The boy?" he asked. "Is he safe?"</p>

<p>"We hope so," replied she gently.</p>

<p>"Only <i>hope</i>, miss?"</p>

<p>"Only hope at present, but my husband has taken his
men to bring him in. We shall soon have good news for
you, please God."</p>

<p>"Ay, please God," said the old man. "The cheild has
come to be like the apple of my eye,&mdash;the best fruit from a
fine old stock, lady. Please God, please God."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to pray with you for his safety?"
asked the lady.</p>

<p>"Ay, ef 'ee will," replied he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brudenel knelt by the old seaman's bed, took his
horny hand in her soft white one, and poured out a
supplication to the God and Father of them both, that
He would keep this boy safely beneath the shadow of His
everlasting wings, and restore him to his friends without
injury.</p>

<p>As she rose from her knees, the old man's lips moved
again. "Amen, amen," he muttered. "Please God, please
God."</p>

<p>He fell into a sleep, still murmuring these words, and
holding the lady's hand.</p>

<p>She did not try to release it, but sat patiently by the
bedside until his fingers relaxed of their own accord, as his
sleep deepened; then leaving the ayah to fan him, and
be ready to give him more nourishment when he should
awake, she stole away in search of her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. Brudenel, having helped his other guests to refresh
themselves after their night's strain of anxiety, having placed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
baths and refreshment before them, had now gathered
his own men together, and, with Mr. Gilchrist and Osborn,
was proceeding to search for Ralph.</p>

<p>"How is your patient, wifey?" asked he, as he observed
his wife's approach.</p>

<p>"Better," said she in a cheerful voice. "He was quite
clear in mind for a short time, and is now asleep. I hope
you will find your young friend safe and well," she added,
turning to Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam," replied he. "If not, I shall feel
guilty of his loss to my dying day, for I took him from
comparative safety, chiefly for my own pleasure in the
company of his bright boyhood."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" cried Mr. Brudenel. "We will have him
all right in a couple of hours. Lads like he take a deal of
killing. I have been in queer places dozens of times
myself, but always turned up again like a bad shilling.
Forward, my friends!"</p>

<p>They rode down the hillside; a turn in the path hid them
from sight; then they reappeared upon the plain through
which the stream flowed, and picked their careful way
across the ford, the horses throwing up the sparkling water
at each step as they splashed through. Then they slowly
mounted the rocky track on the farther side, and disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brudenel watched the cavalcade to this spot, and
then returned to the invalid.</p>

<p>"We will go to the tent first," said Mr. Gilchrist. They
did so. The fire which they had built up was burned down
to a handful of smouldering ashes; the little white note was
still there upon the tree, plainly in sight; the tent was
deserted, no sign was there of any person having visited it.
The silence and solitude was significant and oppressive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>With a gloomy brow, Gilchrist turned his horse's head
towards the defile up which Ralph had fled.</p>

<p>This led away from the direction of the river, back into
the jungle through which they had come, but farther east.
No word was spoken among the searchers as they rode up
the pass. It was very narrow, probably but the bed of a
mountain stream when the rains had fallen plentifully, and
now dry. The jungle closed in thickly upon it, and became
more and more dense as they mounted the hill. The
natives who accompanied the party pointed out the spot
where the two tiger cubs had lain, and been killed. It was
marked by the bleached and scattered bones of various
deer, some sambhurs' horns, and remains of other creatures,
which had formed the prey of the parent animals.</p>

<p>With a sick heart, Gilchrist nerved himself to examine
this débris. He turned over leg bones, skulls, and all which
he could find, not leaving one unnoticed, but none were
human remains. Not the slightest sign appeared to show
that Ralph had been there, nor that the full-grown beasts
had revisited the spot.</p>

<p>They pursued their way with difficulty, so thick was the
tangle of the underwood. Huge ferns reared gigantic
fronds among shrubs of a hundred different kinds; orchids
hung pendant from lofty trees; creepers of many sorts, with
blossoms of every colour, drooped from heights, clung to
branches, wound their devious way from trunk to trunk,
cast curtains of foliage and flower around monarchs of the
forest and humble scrub, touched the fertile virgin earth,
took fresh root, and started upon new complications in other
directions.</p>

<p>But what was this? Dark vultures concealed a massive
form stretched upon the ground in a little glade, comparatively
open. What were they devouring?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>At the approach of the searchers they rose, heavily flapping
their ill-omened pinions, among hoarse cries, and awaited
the completion of their meal from short distances.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist turned very faint, he could not proceed,
he leant against the trunk of a tree while the rest cut their
way through the intervening vines, and a jackal sneaked
away at their approach.</p>

<p>A cry of surprise and relief broke from Mr. Brudenel's
lips.</p>

<p>"It is a female tiger's remains, nothing worse!" shouted
he. "She has been killed by a magnificent shot, here
in the neck! A single bullet did for her! Your man
has been this way, without doubt; and does he not
know how to handle his rifle! <i>He</i> is no bungler, that's
certain."</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist took fresh heart, and approached the spot.
The tiger's bones were picked nearly clean already; the
foul birds of prey had wasted no time. Little but the
skeleton remained of what had, only twenty-four hours
earlier, been so fearsome and so splendid a brute; and which
had been done to death by one little piece of lead buried
in its spine.</p>

<p>The eyes which had glared with yellow fire were
picked clean from the head, the jaws which had uttered
many a dreadful cry were lying wide open in ghastly
mockery of rage, and the tongue was torn from behind
them.</p>

<p>"We will keep this skull," exclaimed Brudenel with
triumph. "There is little else worth carrying off, but
this will be a trophy worth keeping. Your friend has got
safely away from <i>this</i> peril, at anyrate, Gilchrist; we will
find him yet, you will see. He's no fool to have shot like
this!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">Gilchrist smiled. A faint ray of hope pierced into his
heart at the cheery words. It certainly must have been
Denham who had killed that tiger,&mdash;that must have been
the shot which had been heard. But why had he not returned?
Where was he now?</p>

<small>THE DACOIT'S HEAD</small></h2>


<p>The search now proceeded with fresh spirit. Taking the
spot where lay the tiger's carcase as a centre, the party
closely examined every exit from it, but quite fruitlessly.
It was tolerably easy to perceive from which side the shot
had been fired,&mdash;where Denham must have been standing at
that moment,&mdash;they proceeded first in that direction.</p>

<p>A little breakage among some succulent plants betrayed a
slight farther progress there; then this trace ceased wholly.
A wall of thick foliage interposed,&mdash;a purple flower bedecking
it with rare beauty, but it turned them back. A long
stalk of <i>Amherstia</i> lay on the ground at a short distance, as if
it might have been broken off short in an attempt to mount
a tree by its aid, but this clue also failed them.</p>

<p>The glade narrowed at one side to a tiny track, possible
to penetrate. They advanced along it in single file, now
climbing over fallen tree-trunks all smothered in ferns, then
stooping beneath loops and trails of <i>Dendrobiums</i>, and a
variety of plants, matted together with convolvuli, and
tendrils of many kinds.</p>

<p>It opened out upon a blackened vista over which the
jungle fire had swept, burning away every trace of animal
life; a desolate track of waste and ruin, among such super-abundant
life, as was strange to see.</p>

<p>Stranger still to observe a glorious butterfly&mdash;a fragile,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
delicate creature, just emerged from its chrysalis tomb&mdash;spreading
its painted wings, yet damp from its new birth,
in the warmth of the sun as it streamed down upon the
scorched grass. It was a living allegory of Life after Death
which could not fail to strike every soul.</p>

<p>"It is your friend's 'leyp bya,'" said one of the Burmans.
"It must have been out upon a ramble when the fire overtook
him in his sleep, and it cannot now find its home again
in him."</p>

<p>The charred scrub no longer presented further difficulties
in the way of search. It was comparatively easy to penetrate
in almost any direction; and the party separated, scattering
themselves over the cleared space, and closely examining
every rood of ground. Not a sign of man was to be found.
Would any such exist after so fierce a flame had swept over
it? Could it have been expected?</p>

<p>Mr. Brudenel laid his hand upon Gilchrist's shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is useless, my friend," said he. "The boy has gone,
and left no trace. You must bear it like a man. If he yet
should have escaped both fire and wild beast, he will be heard
of in time. He can find us, but we cannot find him."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not say that I must abandon hope!" cried
Gilchrist in agonised tones. "There must be something
yet to be done."</p>

<p>"Offer a reward to any Burman who may bring in the
smallest trace," suggested Osborn. "Those fellows have
their network of connections all over the land. Make it
worth their while to bring in anything that they may find.
The stock of his rifle might be burnt, but the barrel must
be there in some form. So must his hunting-knife, and
many little things, as buttons, buckles, and such like, on his
clothes. No wild beast could eat up thiccee neither."</p>

<p>"I will give any reward which Mr. Brudenel thinks
likely to succeed," cried Gilchrist eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not too fast," remonstrated the police officer. "Offer
too liberal a sum, and, should he live, some of our worthy
neighbours will murder him for sake of it. Leave that to
me, I will manage that."</p>

<p>He had really no hope whatever that Denham lived, but
was too kindly at heart to say so in plain words.</p>

<p>"Stay with me awhile, till we feel that we have turned
every stone to find the lad," he suggested. "You will have
every facility for search with us, and a rest will do yourself
no harm after all you have gone through. Your old man
will not be fit to move yet, either. Let my wife coddle him
up into good health again first, and I can give you some
sport the while."</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist readily accepted the invitation, for he could
not bear the idea of relinquishing all hope of Ralph.</p>

<p>They returned sadly and silently to the station, where
every comfort awaited them, but which they could not
enjoy from a haunting dread of what Ralph might be
suffering in some lonely spot,&mdash;perhaps burned and bruised,
yet living, and beyond help. The nice dinner choked Mr.
Gilchrist, he could not swallow the dainties which Mrs.
Brudenel, in the pride of her young housekeeping, had laid
before them; sleep forsook his pillow; he had no apparent
answer to his prayers; gloom took possession of his soul.</p>

<p>With gentle wile did Mrs. Brudenel try to cheer her
visitor, and distract his thoughts from constant brooding
over the inevitable.</p>

<p>She succeeded with him better than her husband did,
though he was as kind as he knew how to be; but he was
accustomed to rougher experiences, and used to losing his
comrades by death under many phases. His wife walked
in the verandah with her afflicted guest; she told him of
Wills' state, which steadily improved. She consulted him
as to the garden, which she was anxious to make very
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
beautiful, and how to grow the plants which she admired
most, and which were all new to her experience. Gilchrist
tried, for sake of her kindness, to take interest in her
pleasures, despite his heavy heart.</p>

<p>"I fear," said he to her, "that we give you much trouble,
and are sadly in your way."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no! far from that!" cried she eagerly. "You
are such pleasant company for my husband, to whom it is
such a treat to have English faces about him; and you tell
me so nicely how to manage the orchids, of which I am
anxious to have a good collection. Yours is just the help
I wanted; and if you want any drawings of specimens, I
may be of some assistance to you, for I am fond of drawing."</p>

<p>"Fetch some of your pictures, wifey," said Mr. Brudenel.
"See, Gilchrist, is not that thing nice, it looks just as if it
were growing there. I have ordered a carved frame for it,
from a fellow here who does that sort of thing admirably."</p>

<p>"It is indeed an excellent drawing of the specimen,"
said Gilchrist; "but, excuse me, madam, you have copied
the blossom from one plant and the foliage from another."</p>

<p>"I did," said Mrs. Brudenel, surprised. "I only had the
flower, which was brought to me cut from its stem, so I put
in the leaves from that one which grows in the verandah."</p>

<p>"And that one, which is not yet in bloom, will bear a
blossom of white and lemon colour, whereas this is purple
streaked."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Gilchrist!" cried she, in pretty dismay, "what
can be done? Can I alter it and put it right?"</p>

<p>"It would be best to do so, certainly," said he, unpacking
a tin case of his own sketches; which, though less
finished than the lady's drawings, were far more accurate
as botanical specimens. But among them were some of
Ralph's hasty schoolboy productions; one done in a
merry mood, when he had contrived to introduce the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
semblance of a grotesque human face among the convolutions
of the plant. Mr. Gilchrist came upon this unexpectedly,
in his search for the one which he wanted, and
broke down completely over it, as it brought so forcibly
before him the boy's laughing eyes and bright expression
as he had held it up for inspection, with some harmless
nonsense.</p>

<p>Oh, Ralph! Was that smiling face cold and set in
death already? Were those pleasant eyes closed for ever,
those jocund lips pale and grim? Was that dear brave boy
lying scorched and blackened by the jungle flame, or torn
limb from limb by the tiger? Had he gone through so much
by sea and land, for his fate to remain an unsolved mystery
for evermore; a secret&mdash;a dreadful haunting secret&mdash;only
to be divulged on the last day?</p>

<p>Mrs. Brudenel put her kind hand upon Gilchrist's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do not despair, my friend," said she gently; "do not
abandon yourself to despair. God is very good,&mdash;very
merciful. Perhaps Ralph is safe yet. No sign of him
has been found, and had the tiger killed him there surely
would have been some. Let us seek for faith."</p>

<p>"I do not know how to have faith, dear lady," groaned
Mr. Gilchrist. "There seems no ground for faith."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear sir," was her innocent reply, "faith would
not be faith were there ground for it. It is simple trust
in our Father's goodness."</p>

<p>Gilchrist could not reply. He knew that she was right;
he knew that she was nearer to God than he; he felt
rebuked, though she was far from having intended to
administer rebuke,&mdash;it did not occur to her that she had
done so.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes, then she began
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me about Ralph, he must be about the age of my
brother Sydney."</p>

<p>"Not seventeen," replied Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"And what a hero he is! how much bravery he has
shown! Sydney would be so envious of him. He is very
high-spirited and daring too. He is going to be a soldier,&mdash;papa
is a soldier, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam?"</p>

<p>"I have heard papa say that the hardest thing soldiers
have to do is to <i>wait</i> until they are wanted. When they
are charging down upon an enemy, and fighting, they are
carried on by the excitement, and forget everything but
the work in hand. When they are standing still, doing
nothing but keeping steady, and seeing the battle carried
on by others on every hand, it is a very hard thing for
them to hold themselves in."</p>

<p>"Waiting is always hard," said Mr. Gilchrist, sighing.</p>

<p>"Yes. Papa had to do it the very first time when he
was in an engagement. It was in some Indian skirmish
with native troops, and papa's company was one held in
reserve to pour in fresh when the rebels were tired, and
meantime to hold a pass and prevent them from moving
round to the rear of the English. I believe," continued
she, with a smile, "that I am expressing myself badly,
like an ignorant girl, but perhaps you understand what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, your meaning is perfectly clear to me."</p>

<p>"Well, papa found it so hard to stand still, with nothing
to do, that he took up a bit of stick and whittled it to
keep himself steady. When the call to charge was sounded,
he put the half-peeled stick and the handful of chips into
his pocket; he never knew why, or even that he had done
so, until mamma found them there long afterwards, and
asked him why he kept such things. Then the sight of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
them called up the whole scene to him more plainly
than anything else, he said: the dark-faced rebels, with
evil looks and angry eyes; the glare and flashing guns
and smother of smoke; and the poor creatures shot down
before his face, and lying howling and bleeding on the
ground, among plunging horses and shouting men; and
some lying still who had been so raging just before, and
the set determined look upon the Englishmen.</p>

<p>"Mamma has those chips now, put away among her
treasures, and shows them to us sometimes on a Sunday
evening, when we have been reading the Bible to her, and
talking about being resolute, and such things."</p>

<p>"Your story reminds me of the poet's words, 'Those
also serve, who only stand and wait,'" said Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"Yes, does it not," cried she, her sweet face kindling.
"I do so like those lines."</p>

<p>Mr. Brudenel here returned from his morning duties,
and invited Gilchrist to take a turn in the verandah with
him.</p>

<p>"No news yet, I am sorry to say," said he.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist turned to Mrs. Brudenel, "I will try to
'stand and wait,' patiently," said he.</p>

<p>Some excitement was here observed among the natives
and servants. A man had arrived, carrying something large
and round, tied up in a gaily-coloured handkerchief, which
he swung carelessly in his hand as he approached.</p>

<p>The little crowd pressed closely about him, all eagerly
talking at once. Some words attracted Mr. Brudenel's ear,
that of "dacoit" prominent among them. He rose hastily,
and marched down to the excited group.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Mrs. Brudenel, "perhaps the man has
brought news of your friend! let us hasten to hear what
he says. What can he have in that handkerchief?"</p>

<p>She rose, and almost ran through the compound; in her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
eagerness quite outstripping Mr. Gilchrist, who longed,
yet dreaded, to hear the news which he felt had come at
last.</p>

<p>Mr. Brudenel lifted his hand in warning to his wife, but
she did not perceive his caution; nor, in the babble of
Burmese tongues, catch his desire that she should not be
present.</p>

<p>"What have you there?" asked she in her excitement,
airing one of the few phrases of the language which had
been so recently taught to her.</p>

<p>Quite proud to be addressed by the English lady, and
pleased with himself, his burden, and the news which he
had to impart, the Burman untied his bundle with an
amiable grin of delight, and out rolled, to the horrified
girl's feet, the ghastly, gory, head of a dacoit chief, with
its fierce expression set in death upon the parted blackened
lips, and in the deep lines around the sunken eyes.</p>

<p>With blanched face, she recoiled in terror; and her
husband, hurrying forward, passed his stalwart arm around
her for protection, while she hid her face on his breast.</p>

<p>The Burman, meantime, was pouring out a flood of
explanations, and the history of his having watched the
robber, seen him possessed of English things, followed,
tracked him from place to place, and, finally, set upon
him in a lonely spot, killed him, searched him, and found
upon him&mdash;this!&mdash;holding up a silver watch.</p>

<p>It was Ralph Denham's watch, Mr. Gilchrist knew it
well. Moreover, it had R. D. engraved upon it on the
back. It had been a present to him from his mother before
he sailed, he valued it extremely, and had it upon him
when the <i>Pelican</i> was abandoned, being almost the only
thing of value which he had saved. Indeed, it was nearly
the only trinket which he had ever possessed.</p>

<p>How it had fallen into the robber's hands could not now
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
be ever known, for the man was dead. Had poor Denham
escaped the tiger, been spared from the fire, to fall a prey
at last to a fellow-man? Had he been the victim of other
perils, and had the dacoit only found the watch in the jungle
and appropriated it? Was the fellow even venturing to
bring it in for the reward, and could he have told more of
the gallant lad's fate? Who could say now?</p>

<p>Mr. Brudenel questioned the Burman closely, seeking
confirmation of the story in its every detail of place and
time. The man knew nothing of Denham, nor as to how
the watch had fallen into the hands of the dacoit, who
was one of a band of robbers that was harrying the mountain
villages at a little distance. The watch was useless
to him evidently. It had run down, and was silent.
Either he had not possessed the key, or did not understand
how to use it; and he had worn it round his neck as
an ornament in a conspicuous manner, which had attracted
the Burman's notice.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mr. Gilchrist paid the offered reward in silence, carried
the watch into the house, and, laying it down, broke into
a passion of grief which, for a time, admitted of no
consolation.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />

<small>LOST IN THE JUNGLE</small></h2>


<p>Ralph, upon flying from the infuriated elephant, had
followed the defile before described, rushing up its tortuous
windings with little heed beyond that of his own safety. If
he thought at all, he believed that the others were following
him at no great distance; attracted, as he had been, by the
rough stones lying in the bed of the stream; where, after
the rains, it tumbled headlong down the pass, a mountain
torrent of double its present width. The loose boulders, and
jagged fragments of rock, would, he considered, cut the pads
in the elephant's feet and deter the animal's pursuit. In
this he was mistaken, but the idea guided his flight at the
time.</p>

<p>He did not pause for reflection; it was instinct more
than deliberation which impelled his flight. On he ran;
his active, well-trained young limbs covering the ground
rapidly; leaping from rock to boulder, springing over pool
and marshy hollow, and instinctively taking advantage of
every soft grassy slope.</p>

<p>All at once his heedless progress was arrested by summary
disaster. He stepped upon something soft, which turned
beneath his foot instead of proving to be a rounded hard
stone. A fearful screech was heard, curdling the very
marrow in his bones, and bringing his heart to his mouth as
he fell, measuring his length prone upon the sward. An
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
unearthly spitting and growling assailed him, which, as he
quickly came to himself after the shock of his fall, he first
thought emanated from an enraged cat; but the next
moment, was, he perceived, the token of something far
worse.</p>

<p>He had tumbled over two young tiger cubs, and their
dam was hurrying up to their rescue, from the pool where
she had been drinking.</p>

<p>He saw the rich colour of her soft fur; he marked the
beautiful dark waving lines crossing the yellow body; the
graceful power of her strong limbs was impressed upon his
mind in the moment's view which he had of her, lifting her
head from the water at the cry of her offspring, and bounding
back to their lair.</p>

<p>Then she crouched for her spring upon him, the sun
lighting up her splendid eyes, contracted as they were
from the intentness with which they glared at him, her
tail lashing itself to and fro, as she warily crept two steps
nearer, with fell purpose apparent in her every curve.</p>

<p>That pause for her spring saved him. How he took his
aim he never knew; he could not have done it had he
stayed to consider, it was an accuracy born of desperation.
He seized his gun, as he rose to his feet, pointed it, fired,
and saw her drop. The shot had entered the creature's
neck, near the shoulders, and pierced directly to its heart.
She rolled over with a faint struggle, and was still for evermore.</p>

<p>Oblivious of the death of their dam, the two cubs, replete
with food, were already curling themselves around to resume
their disturbed sleep.</p>

<p>Ralph could not believe in his own deliverance. He
dropped his arms, and stood for a moment dumbfounded,
expecting to see that agile sinuous mass of beautiful peril
move again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>He gazed at it in silent, fixed horror, till, gradually
realising that he was saved from it as by a miracle, he drew
a long breath.</p>

<p>At the very same moment he became aware of two
brilliant points of topaz-hued light fixed upon him from
the jungle.</p>

<p>They were the eyes of the male tiger, stealthily advancing
upon him from another side.</p>

<p>It was too much for the boy. Terror seized upon him,
and he fled precipitately in the reverse direction; tearing his
way through creeper and jungle-grass, breaking through
bush and bramble, panting, gasping and sick with fear, till,
perceiving a gnarled tree easy to climb, he flung down his
gun and swung himself upwards, from branch to branch, till
he could seat himself upon a point of safety.</p>

<p>The tiger leapt, and leapt short of his prey. With a roar
of baffled rage it bounded up to the tree where the boy sat
with blanched cheeks and horror-distended eyes, and, rearing
itself upon its hind legs, stretched a strong paw upwards
in endeavour to reach its enemy and pull him from his
refuge. Up went Ralph's legs with an instinctive spasm.
He crouched closer to the branch where he sat, and clung
faster to the boughs and cord-like creepers around him.</p>

<p>The tiger, with ferocious growls, snuffed at the gun,
prowled round the tree, and cast baleful glances upwards to
the place where the boy was plainly visible; but it made no
attempt to climb the trunk, which Ralph feared it would
do. He did not know enough about the habits or power of
these creatures to be sure what it would attempt; and was
alternately divided between this dread and that of being no
longer able to maintain his hold, but of falling headlong from
his perch into the grasp of those cruel fangs and terrible
paws.</p>

<p>But though every minute seemed to be an hour, the time
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
was not really very long before the creature gave up its
pursuit, and made off with head drooping and a long stealthy
stride of its supple limbs.</p>

<p>Ralph could not at first believe himself to be safe. He
thought that the tiger might return; he thought that it was
watching him from some secret lair; he was not certain
that his shot had proved fatal to the female tiger; and the
more he thought about it, the less probable did he consider
it that she was dead. He glanced this way and that, expecting
to see a gleam of golden colour creeping among the
undergrowth of deep green scrub; he strained his ears to
hear soft footsteps crash among the brushwood, or low-muttered
growls uttered beneath him.</p>

<p>He was cramped and stiff from his attitude and the
rigidity of his hold; he grew very cold as the sun went
down; he was hungry and very, very thirsty; his lips were
parched, his mouth fevered,&mdash;yet he dared not descend the
tree.</p>

<p>After a long time, he ventured to change his position to
one of greater ease. He shifted his place to a mighty
branch, upon which he might recline at full length, or sit
with his back against the bole. Then he began to wonder
what had become of his companions. He could see none of
them, nor hear a sound which could proceed from human
lips.</p>

<p>Where were they? What were they doing? Why did
they not come to seek him? Had any of them been
trampled under foot by that mad elephant, or devoured by
the tigers? Surely some dreadful thing must have befallen
them, or they would have come to his assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist&mdash;Wills&mdash;Osborn&mdash;why did none of them
come?</p>

<p>By degrees his thoughts concentrated themselves upon
his gun. It must not be there in the long grass, dark and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
wet with heavy dew. He must go down and take it up,
but dreaded the descent. Still, his gun must not become
rusted and useless, or what would become of him. Slowly,
silently, he crept down, swinging himself from bough to
bough, pausing and listening every moment for the tiger's
low growl. Now he thought that he heard it; then he
believed that it was but his imagination. Under one idea,
he hung poised in air; under the other, he ventured a little
farther. All at once a treacherous branch, to which he
had trusted his weight, gave way beneath him; and, with a
sudden jerk, he fell crashing down to the ground.</p>

<p>His fall was broken by the thick tangle of the undergrowth,
so that he fractured no bones, but he was terribly
shaken, cut and scratched, and one foot sprained.</p>

<p>For a few moments he lay stunned; then pulled himself
together, reached out for the gun, and having possessed
himself of it, tried to mount the tree again. But he could
not succeed. His arms felt as if they had been all but
pulled out of their sockets; blood trickled into his eyes
from a deep scratch on his brow, and blinded him.</p>

<p>But he dared not remain upon the ground, so he moved
on a little to seek a tree which might be easier to climb.
The moon had risen in radiant beauty, and there was
plenty of light, but no tree suitable to his purpose grew
about that spot, and he moved deeper into the jungle, as he
thought that now here, now there, he had found one.</p>

<p>He did discover one at last, made his painful ascent of it,
and, when he thought that he had mounted sufficiently high,
he found a tolerably easy seat, and determined to await the
dawn there.</p>

<p>He was extremely tired, but was afraid to sleep lest some
snake or noxious insect should coil around him or sting him.
He had enough to do to ward off the attacks of myriads of
creatures as it was. Mosquitoes hummed gaily over their
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
feast upon him; huge beetles flopped in his face, smaller
ones ran up his trousers and sleeves, and tried to penetrate
down his back.</p>

<p>Ants got into his boots, and slimy things crawled over his
hands and endeavoured to fix themselves on his face or
neck, or cling to his hair. Would the tardy day never
begin to break?</p>

<p>What was that red glow upon the sky to the eastward?
It was not like the dawn, it was not in the right place,&mdash;but
what could it be? It was like the reflection, upon the sky,
of a mighty fire,&mdash;but where was the fire? He could see
none.</p>

<p>Ralph was not aware how far he had run up the defile,
or noticed the direction which he had taken in escaping
from the tiger. In reality he had skirted round the farther
base of the hill upon which the police-station was situated,
and was wandering in the jungle at its base.</p>

<p>The tardy sun rose at last; much of the terror of the
night was swept away under its beneficent influence.
Ralph pulled himself together, determined to walk off his
stiffness and soreness; shouldered his gun, and set off&mdash;down
quite a new gulley, under the idea that he was
returning down the same through which he had come on
the previous afternoon; and limped resolutely forward,
away from his friends, away from the station, away from all
help and succour.</p>

<p>He walked for a long time before he found that he was
not going rightly, for the defile came to an end. Its close
was completed by a wide shallow pool, fringed with bamboo
canes, and upon which many water-fowl were disporting
themselves, while more were preening their plumage upon
its banks.</p>

<p>The sight made him feel how hungry he was, and he
argued to himself that the sound of his gun would betray
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
his whereabouts to his friends, who would answer the signal
by another to let him know in which direction to turn. He
fired, therefore, upon the covey nearest to him, and two
plump birds fell.</p>

<p>Forgetting his fatigue and his lame foot in the excitement,
he splashed through the muddy shallows and pools, picked
up his game, and brought it back to <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>"Well," said he to himself, "there is nothing to be gained
by rambling farther away. I may as well stay here and
cook my breakfast, for I don't know which way to go, and
it is as likely that I should go wrongly as in the right way.
If they don't hear my gun, they will perhaps see the smoke
of a fire, which will guide them."</p>

<p>He therefore gathered some dry fuel in a heap, and,
having the good fortune to discover some cutchwood trees,
collected the withered branches lying scattered around, and
soon had a splendid fire. The flames emitted from the
cutchwood were, however, too fierce for his cookery, so he
piled on some greener wood, and sat down to pluck his
birds, while the blaze was dying down to a nice glowing
bed of red ashes.</p>

<p>We say "pluck his birds," but Ralph was no gourmand;
nor was he cook to a first-class gentleman's club. Plucking
was too lengthy an operation for him; he cut the skin of
his game down the back, and pulled it off, inside out, like a
stocking from a foot, having first chopped off the heads
and legs.</p>

<p>This operation was completed before his fire was ready;
so he took a plunge into a clear pool, reclothed himself,
and then broiled his breakfast, having split his birds open
like spatch-cocks.</p>

<p>"They are not bad," thought he, as he devoured them,
tearing their limbs apart by help of fingers and knife, like a
young ogre. "They are not bad, though they would have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
been more savoury if I had had some pepper and salt, with
a dab of butter. How Agnes would have jeered at me as
man-cook. I wonder what the dear old girl is doing now.
She little thinks where I am. Lost in a Burmese jungle!
What a pretty kettle of fish it is. I know no more than the
man in the moon which way to go, or what to do. Well,
no predicament is so bad that it can't be mended. If I
walk straight on, I must come somewhere, sooner or later.
Those fellows don't mean to join me here, that's plain. So
Ralph Denham, Esq., marching orders are yours. Forward!"</p>

<p>He knew that he must regain the main stream of the
Salween River, up the eastern bank of which his party had
come; but where was the Salween? He must climb one
of these mountain-spurs,&mdash;one sufficiently lofty to command
a bird's-eye view of the country, so that he could take its
bearings. He therefore set himself to the ascent of the
most lofty hill which he could perceive.</p>

<p>The ascent was, however, no joke. His foot was very
painful. He had dipped his handkerchief in water, and
bound it tightly round the ankle, but the heat rapidly dried
it, nor could he constantly find means of rewetting it to keep
it cool.</p>

<p>The jungle grew thicker and thicker, more and more
impenetrable, with every step. He had to cut his way with
his knife through the tangle of creepers, linked and bound
together in impenetrable masses, and his knife soon became
wholly inadequate to the task.</p>

<p>To proceed straight forward was utterly impossible, for
the thickness of the interlacing stems quite baffled his
strength. He found an easier place to the right, and
essayed that; but after a few steps he was pulled up
again. He discovered a slighter barrier to the left, again
to be baffled wholly.</p>

<p>After hours of work, he had advanced but a dozen yards,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and made up his mind that to penetrate such a jungle as
this, with no better appliances than he possessed, and with
no help, was a completely hopeless task.</p>

<p class="pmb3">He sat down to rest, and consider what would be his next
best plan.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />

<small>JUNGLE THIEVES</small></h2>


<p>It was easy to sit down, and easy to ponder the question,
but any decision at all was another matter. All the thinking
in the world would not tell him either where he was or
which way he ought to go; and the more he deliberated,
the more puzzled he became.</p>

<p>To mount the hills was impossible, from the impenetrability
of the jungle; to follow a stream was to expose himself
to the attacks of wild beasts coming to the water to
drink. How then could he proceed? But to remain still
was quite as unsafe, for he had but a small quantity of
powder and shot; and when this was expended, would be
wholly at the mercy of savage animals.</p>

<p>To follow the windings of a stream must lead him, in
process of time, to some large river; and the danger of this
course was no greater than that of any other. He determined
to adopt this plan, and prepared for a start; first
recommending his safety, by prayer, to Divine mercy, and
imploring for help and guidance from on high.</p>

<p>Forlorn enough did he feel as he resumed his gun and
other accoutrements, preparatory for so hopeless a task, but
he tried to be brave, and once more set himself, as a
preliminary, to "hang his harp on a willow tree."</p>

<p>It would not do, his voice sounded thin and poor, there
was no volume in it; the silence around him seemed yet
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
more awful in contrast to it; the words struck him as most
intensely foolish in face of the majesty of nature which
surrounded him.</p>

<p>He gave it up, and tried the Old Hundredth Psalm. This
brought up, to his mental vision, the picture of his home,
and the dreary old hand-organ man who droned out that
psalm tune in the street regularly every Friday morning.</p>

<p>He could see Agnes in the shabby little parlour, and his
mother's sweet, sad face, in her widow's cap, with the
crippled baby in her arms. A great lump rose in his throat,
and he dashed his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>But it would never do to become sentimental, as he
termed it, so he set himself vigorously to finding a suitable
stream to follow. Now, the difficulty became that of finding
any at all.</p>

<p>The jungle surrounded him on every side, he could not
free himself from it. Every now and then he found what
he thought a free glade or opening pathway, which he
would pursue for a short distance, only to be again brought
up in front of a tangle of creepers, glorious in colour, rich
in purple or yellow festoons of exquisite flowers; snowed
over with pure white blossoms, long wreaths of beauty
pendant from the branches of the trees, and wholly preventing
any progress.</p>

<p>Exquisite as the orchids and other plants were, he became
weary of them and their sameness. Their perfume sickened
him, their glory palled upon his sight. They were the same
kinds&mdash;now common to him&mdash;over and over again. Oh, for a
clump of English primroses nestled among moss and last
year's brown leaves! Oh, for a bush of pink wild-roses, with
golden hearts and delicate faint fragrance wafted upon a
light breeze! Here everything was heavy and oppressive;
too brilliant, too much, too unfamiliar, too unlike home.</p>

<p>Insect and reptile life troubled him greatly. The weather
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
was growing very hot, and the density of the trees impeded
every current of cool air. This was doubtless the cause of
the difficulty in finding water, it was drying up so fast everywhere.
Leeches got upon his legs, fixing themselves upon
him with far too affectionate a tenacity; ants ran up his
trousers, got into his boots; a thousand and one flying and
crawling plagues assailed him.</p>

<p>Snakes and serpents wound their tails round trees,
dropped coils in his path, and lifted flat heads from their
meditations, to gaze on him with malevolent eyes. He did
not know which were harmless and which were deadly,
so suffered the same qualms alike from all.</p>

<p>He had a vague idea that a dark-coloured snake was more
perilous than a yellow or green one, and never suffered more
terror than when, sitting down to rest, and having fallen
asleep, he perceived, upon waking, a long black thing reared
on end, with pendant head bent over him.</p>

<p>For one moment he felt sick with horror, then perceived
that it was the stem of a flower which he had never seen
before, and which he had either overlooked from his
fatigue when he sat down, or which had shot up its bloom
with the most marvellous celerity while he was unconscious.</p>

<p>He had, indeed, slept for hours, having been quite worn
out; and a special Providence must have guarded him
during this long somnolence, or some noxious insect would
certainly have attacked him the while.</p>

<p>It was late in the day, the dews were falling thickly
after the heat of the noontide; and a quantity of hares
were hopping about, feeding upon the grass around him.
They did not seem to be afraid of him, and he shot one
without difficulty, and looked forward to making a good
supper upon him, for he was hungry.</p>

<p>He laid it at the foot of the tree beneath which he had
reposed, and began to collect wood with which to make a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
fire. Whilst doing this, he lost sight of the hare for a few
minutes; and, on returning to the spot where he had laid
it, he found a couple of huge crows tugging away at it to
make it their own; and the burying beetles already
digging a grave beneath it. An army of ants was swarming
over it, and so persistent in their attentions that
they would not leave it even when Ralph tore the skin
off its back, and set it down to cook by his fire, wrapped
thickly up in leaves.</p>

<p>However, he was too hungry to be very particular,
although nothing had ever yet brought him to eat fried
caterpillars or maggots, as a Burman will. He scraped off
the ants to the best of his ability, and sought, while his
meal was preparing, for some fruits, of which to make an
agreeable conclusion to it.</p>

<p>He had the good fortune to discover some, of which he
immediately partook, being parched and feverish. They
refreshed him; and it was perhaps partly from this cause,
and partly from his long sleep, that, his senses being perfectly
alert, he chanced to notice a small orchid blooming upon a
tree which he was convinced was one quite new to Mr.
Gilchrist's collection. It differed in several material points
from all which he had yet seen, but was certainly an orchid.</p>

<p>He carefully cut away the piece of bark upon which it
grew, and looked about for more of it. He found another
very small plant, which he secured, but the evening was
becoming too dark for him to seek farther. He therefore
returned to his fire, and made himself as comfortable beside
it as circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>He did not sleep much that night, but dozed and woke
again many times,&mdash;piling green wood upon the embers every
time, so that the smoke thus engendered should keep off
the mosquitoes from him.</p>

<p>At a little distance, beneath the trees, the fireflies
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
swarmed, flashing about hither and thither, and making
light in shady places. This light was caught and returned
by the shining backs of a thousand beetles,&mdash;green, blue,
crimson, and copper-hued. Flying foxes flitted by in search
of guavas and other fruits; and bats of every size and
description swarmed around, hawking on the wing for their
suppers.</p>

<p>Ralph watched all these creatures dreamily, seeing, but
too drowsy to think about them actively. The heavy scent
of night-perfumed flowers overpowered his faculties, and
confused his powers of mind, almost as much as if he had
partaken of a narcotic.</p>

<p>Was it only a dream, or a dream-like fancy then, or did
he really hear the faint ripple of flowing water? His senses
became all at once preternaturally acute. He sprang up
from his reclining position, and listened intently. No, it
was not a mistake,&mdash;it was not a trick of the imagination;
a little rill of water was running over stones hard by. In
the comparative silence of the night the gentle sound made
itself plainly audible.</p>

<p>He did not dare to leave the friendly protection of his
fire in the dark, the jungle was too full of danger for that,
but he laid a long branch, torn from a bush, in the direction
from which the sound proceeded, and anxiously awaited
the dawn.</p>

<p>It came at last,&mdash;dank and chilly even in that tropical
climate; he rose, and perceived not far from him a slender
thread of water slipping gaily along beneath ferns and grass
and reeds; now breaking into a laugh over a few scattered
stones and branches, then spreading into a tiny pool looking
deep from brown shadows cast by overhanging growth.</p>

<p>Ralph laved his brow in it, cast its refreshing coolness
over head and neck, drank of it, bathed his orchids in it,
and knelt down to thank God for having at last found the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
clue by which he might possibly escape from the horrors of
death in this lonely jungle. If die he must, he might now,
at anyrate, die in the open country, with the sun of heaven
above him.</p>

<p>Not even Arethusa herself, "shepherding her bright
fountains," slipping down the rocks "with her golden
locks, streaming among the streams," in the land of poesy,
on the other side of the world, could have been so lovely
in his eyes as this little unheard of, unnamed, unknown
streamlet, in the heart of a Burmese forest.</p>

<p>The wild cat lapped it, and slunk away; a magnificent,
many-hued dragon-fly, just burst from the sheath of its
chrysalis upon the stem of a reed, was drying its gauzy
wings in the level beams of the rising sun, as they shot
through the trees just above the flower-enamelled grass,
that sparkled with dew as if besprinkled with gems of every
colour. A thousand little birds, awakened by the recurring
daylight, chirped and sang and preened their feathers in
the freshness of those early hours. Ralph's spirits also
arose from the depression which had overcome them, and
he sang once more as he arranged his dress, and reloaded
himself with his accoutrements.</p>

<p>He now found more of the new orchid; and, still further
impressed by a conviction of its rarity, he possessed himself
of all that he could carry safely. This did not overburden
him, for it was not plentiful; and, having packed it up,
carefully swathed in damp grass, bound over that with liana
stems, and protected by bark, he set himself to follow the
course of the stream.</p>

<p>The water bubbled along in a very tortuous course,
marking its way everywhere by a line of brighter, more
tender emerald; and doubtless fed by hidden springs,
for it grew wider in process of time, spreading out into
a large pool whereon water-lilies reposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>The blossoms had mostly gone to seed, which stood up
from the stems like acorns, but a few late ones still floated
on the bosom of the lake,&mdash;blue, pink, and white.</p>

<p>The edges of the water were fringed with flowering reeds;
passion-flowers tossed clinging tendrils from tree to tree on
its margin, and long wreaths of bud and blossom hung
pendant from them.</p>

<p>Myriads of new-born butterflies flitted sportively among
them, and bright birds skimmed over the quiet water. It
was a most lovely sight,&mdash;one which Ralph never afterwards
forgot. He rested upon the shore of this lake through
the hottest part of the day; breakfasting upon some
plantains which he had found, and upon the lily seeds and
sprouts.</p>

<p>When a little air sprang up towards evening, he resumed
his course.</p>

<p>The jungle closed around him again; but he now held
the thread of the maze, and lost heart no more. He
passed the night in a tree, and his evening orisons were
heartfelt.</p>

<p>Day by day he plodded on. The stream grew wider,
but wound so much that his progress through the country
was very slow. When it grew sufficiently broad to admit
of the navigation of any kind of craft, Ralph made up his
mind to try whether he could not proceed faster upon a
raft; and pondered much upon the means of constructing
one which, though rudely fashioned, might serve his
purpose.</p>

<p>His thoughts reverted at first to the coracles of ancient
Britain, which he had heard were of basket-work covered
with skins. Canes for basket-work abounded, but he did
not see how to procure skins of a sufficiently large size, or
how to cut them into shape or join them together.</p>

<p>He then thought of the North-American Indian's birch-bark
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
canoe. But he had no means of felling a suitable tree,
or of peeling the bark off in large sheets.</p>

<p>His mind reverted again to the wicker-work. He could
cut down bamboos, and they grew plentifully everywhere.
Could he tie them together by means of the cord-like
lianas which bound the jungle so closely together into
impenetrable masses? If not, he might weave them together
with split cane or supple reeds.</p>

<p>Another consideration puzzled him. The stream was
narrow; his raft must be no wider than necessary,&mdash;but
what ought its length to be? It would not be manageable
if very long; but how much surface should there be to
support his weight on the water. He had no data upon
which to go that could enable him to decide this point;
experiment alone could do so. He would try making it
as long as his own height; and, if that did not suffice, he
could then enlarge it.</p>

<p>He cleared a space upon the borders of the stream, laid
down upon it, and marked out his own proportions. Then
he narrowed each end to a point beyond these limits, so
that he might work the raft either way; drove short stakes
into the ground all around the enclosure, laid stout bamboos
athwart the centre of it, and bound them to the stakes.
He tied together a bundle of long bamboos at each end,
laid them lengthways upon those firmly affixed to the points,
and spreading them out in the middle, began to weave all
together with split canes, which had been steeping in
water, to make them pliant, while everything else was
being prepared.</p>

<p>When this was made as firm as lay in his power, he
perceived that, though it might float and bear his weight,
that burden would sink it a little below the surface of the
water, so that he would always be wet. The stakes with
which he had begun his contrivance were about two feet
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
long&mdash;perhaps nearer three feet; and though not very
regular in height, were all driven into the ground about
equally far. It was above the ground that they were
uneven.</p>

<p>He therefore began again, weaving a second floor about
six inches above the first one. This had also the effect of
making all steadier; and upon noticing this, he once more
set to work, and wove a narrow bulwark above what he
called his upper deck.</p>

<p>He cut a couple of bundles of long bamboos, which he
tied along the bulwarks, to use in case of need; fashioned
rude rowlocks in the centre; cut a quantity of grass, which
he spread as a carpet for his feet; bound up a sheaf of the
same to serve for a pillow at night; provided a store of
liana twigs and split cane for repairs, if necessary; made
his packet of orchids secure to stakes; and, finally, began
to lay in a small store of fruit for food.</p>

<p>The stream was drying up so fast upon its shallow borders
that fish were left flapping about in holes, or on the mud,
every day; and, not sharing in the Burman's superstition as
to taking life, he had made many a meal upon them,&mdash;for
the construction of his raft had occupied several days. So
few charges of powder and shot had he left, that he would
not use his gun, thinking that he might want it for self-preservation
before he could reach civilised regions.</p>

<p>When fish was not to be got, he had eaten fruit when he
could find it; he had knocked down a bird or two by throwing
sticks at them, for they were very tame at first, but were
now becoming more afraid of him; and once he had been
fortunate enough to come across some jungle-fowl's eggs.</p>

<p>Such a piece of luck had not befallen him again, however;
and he had cleared his immediate neighbourhood of
plantains, so he must go farther afield for stores.</p>

<p>The weather was very hot, and he had worked about his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
boat building, all these days, in his shirt and linen drawers.
His other garments, with his gun and other small
possessions, were neatly laid together on the low-growing
branch of a shrub, in a place where he could easily see them;
and now, taking up his knife, which he carried with a
lanyard about his neck, and with a coil of grass-rope in his
hand, he pulled on his boots, and set off into the jungle.</p>

<p>He was tolerably successful in his quest, but had to roam
about for some time first. As the sun was preparing to set,
he returned to the place that had begun to feel almost like
a home to him,&mdash;that natural clearance among the trees; the
clump of bushes on the little promontory jutting out into
the stream; the huge <i>Amherstia</i> crowning the many-tinted
scrub, with the white <i>Dendrobium Formosum</i> hanging down
from it in such rich masses.</p>

<p>What were those parti-coloured figures at the foot of the
tree where his garments hung? Men? Burmese? <i>Not
dacoits?</i> But what else could they be? The ragged gaudy
"putsoes," the white fillets around the heads, the gaunt
frames, the fierce yet sly faces, all told their own tale.
Ralph had heard of these robbers, and slipt stealthily back
into the jungle, where, himself concealed, he could watch
their proceedings.</p>

<p>They were examining his clothes with grins of delight.
One had his beloved watch hung round his neck, and
dangling about with every movement. One was cutting
buttons off with great glee; and one was investigating the
gun.</p>

<p>Now this gun was not a very good one; it had been
purchased in the bazaar of Moulmein, in preparation for
Ralph's first expedition with Mr. Gilchrist, when money was
short with them both, while awaiting their better equipments
from home.</p>

<p>But it was lighter than the fine new ones sent out from
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
England, and was a favourite one with its young owner,
though Wills often told him that he would meet with some
accident with it one of these days, the weapon being so
worn.</p>

<p>The Burman who held it was ramming in powder and
shot most liberally; driving in more and more with the
greatest delight, laughing and joking the while with more
merriment than discretion.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the fun, the old thing exploded&mdash;burst!&mdash;with
a mighty report, and all the Burmese thieves
were prostrate immediately.</p>

<p>Ralph thought at first that they were all killed, and was
on the point of rushing forward to see the extent of the
injuries received, when one raised himself, and then another.
With the most rueful faces they wagged their heads to each
other, each looking solemnly at his neighbour for a moment.</p>

<p>The third was hurt and bleeding, but whether seriously
injured Ralph could not tell. His companions rose, seized
him by the feet, and drew him, on his back, by that means
to some distance from the scene of the disaster; and, passing
near enough to Ralph's hiding-place, he heard them jabbering
together about the "beloo" which had thus revenged
itself upon them. They seemed shy of approaching the
place where the shattered gun lay, and Denham thought
that it would do them good to hear a little more of the
"beloo."</p>

<p>Accordingly, he began to moan, upon which the fellows
gave a great start, and gazed around with terrified faces.
Seeing this, and being himself concealed behind a large tree,
the boy increased his moan to a howl,&mdash;a yell,&mdash;the most
unearthly screeches which he could raise. It was too much
for the dacoits, they sprang to their feet and ran off as fast
as their legs could take them, becoming quickly lost in the
shadows of night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Rightly judging that their dwellings could not be very
far off, and that they might return by daylight, Ralph
hastened to loose his raft, and push it off from its moorings
down the stream, determining to pursue his way as far as
possible before morning.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The raft floated well, to his joyful surprise; he punted it
along successfully, and was far away before the day star
rose.</p>


<p class="break" />

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>


<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />

<small>THE RAPIDS</small></h2>


<p>Had Ralph known it, he was now not so very far from his
friends. The stream, down which he was floating, was a
tributary of that on the banks of which he had become
separated from them, flowing down the next valley between
the hills, and becoming merged in the larger one some five
or six miles below the police-station.</p>

<p>The range of hills between them was higher and more
abrupt than that upon which the police-station was situated,
concealing it from view; but the density of the forest and
jungle made its inhabitants widely dispersed. They were
wholly composed of small scattered remnants of wild
Karens, constantly fighting with each other, split up into
small numbers, of which half a dozen families would suffice
to stock a village, and incessantly changing their abode.</p>

<p>They would come to a jungle-covered hill, and set it on
fire. When a sufficient space for their wants was burnt out,
they planted rice upon the ground manured by the ashes,
ran up a few hovels with bamboos and palm leaves, and
awaited their harvest. This gathered, the same land would
not bear a second crop; and, space being unlimited, the
remedy was simple. They only moved to another hillside,
and repeated the fire and farming manoeuvres.</p>

<p>When their own rice failed them, they helped themselves
to that belonging to other villages or tribes, provided these
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
were weaker than themselves. Sometimes they made a
mistake on this point, and became wiped off the face of the
land. If this did not happen, they generally wiped out the
others; for, if anyone escaped, he was bound to slay as many
of his enemies as he had lost of friends. This species of
vendetta was a religion to them all, and a curious comment
upon the idea that, to take life of any description, was to shut
the gates of the highest heaven upon the slayer.</p>

<p>The Burman will not destroy the principle of life even in
noxious animals, but murder is his commonest crime, and
his murders are often accompanied with great atrocity.</p>

<p>The dacoits who plundered Ralph fell into the power of
an enemy's tribe, and the chief's head was carried to the
police-station for sake of the reward paid for all such
tribute; and while Mr. Gilchrist was sadly mourning over
what he considered the certain proof of his young friend's
death, in the discovery of his watch, Denham had passed
the junction of the two rivulets, and was prosperously
pursuing his voyage towards the Salween River.</p>

<p>We say "prosperously," though, in good sooth, the
voyage was carried on with many vicissitudes. The stream
narrowed day by day, as the extreme heat dried up its
margins. Now the frail barque stuck helplessly in the mud,
which was yet too soft to bear walking upon.</p>

<p>Ralph would sink up to his knees as he pulled and
hauled his little craft out of the shallows, and set it once
more afloat.</p>

<p>Then he would become entangled in débris of the forest,&mdash;sticks,
rotten stumps, masses of leaves, etc., all stuck
together in one jumble, and caught by a little promontory,
wafted into some tiny bay, or even detained by the
drooping boughs of some tree or shrub dipping into the
water, to coagulate and solidify into a floating island.</p>

<p>Poor Ralph's garments were of the slightest description,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
for he had left all which he had possessed at first&mdash;little
enough at the best&mdash;when he fled from the dacoits. It
was well for him that he had retained his knife; but at
least his clothes, such as they were, dried easily in the sun,
which was a good thing, as they were wetted through and
through every day.</p>

<p>"I wish I were an Israelite in the desert," thought he, as
his only button came off, and he cut a hole in his waistband
and tied a loop of twisted grass into it. "How I am
ever to get into a suit of broadcloth again passes me to
imagine. But it is well for me that folks are not very
particular hereabouts."</p>

<p>On the fifth day of his voyage he saw the vista open
before him, and a wide expanse of water appeared to his
sight. This must be, he thought, the Salween River; and
he hoped that his troubles were now approaching their end.</p>

<p>"I shall soon come to an English settlement, or a
missionary station, or at least to some Burmese village," he
thought; "and some good Christian will help me on my way.
What a pretty place this is!"</p>

<p>The river upon which he had now emerged wound very
much, and almost took the appearance of a succession of
lakes. Hills clothed with jungle shut it in, and stretches
of rocky land jutted out from either side at irregular
distances.</p>

<p>Protected from the force of the deeper current by one of
these little promontories, the rapidity of the stream down
which he had come shot him well out into the wider river
with a velocity which surprised him; though, in his ignorance
of what it meant, he considered it "very jolly" at first to
be cleared of all the impedimenta which had hitherto
encumbered him so sadly.</p>

<p>But this was only a momentary joy, as his frail barque was
caught in a power beyond his control, and whirled about in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a manner which even he saw meant mischief. He had but
one thing to save&mdash;his orchids. He had prepared for a
catastrophe of some sort previously, and had them merely
slung by a long cord to a cane. He caught this off, throwing
the loop around his neck, and in five minutes more
was battling with rapids for his life, his raft beaten into a
thousand pieces.</p>

<p>He had clutched, with the energy of despair, the stout
bamboo which he had used to punt his raft; and, clinging
instinctively to this, was tossed down some two or three
feet; plunged overhead in a pool, floated up again; washed
violently against rough stones; felt his feet, lost them again,
was rolled over; dashed down another little cascade; and
brought up, finally, breathless, bruised, battered and bleeding,
upon a tiny ait in the centre of the stream, where his
bamboo had become entangled between some small bushes.</p>

<p>He had but strength enough to catch at a firmer support,
and draw himself up upon the islet, where he lay, utterly
spent, for a long time.</p>

<p>Everything darkened before his eyes, the earth seemed
to reel beneath him, all the heavens to be unsteady above
him, and he became unconscious.</p>

<p>He must have remained so for long; as, when he slowly
came to himself again, the stars were jewelling the purple
vault above him, and the full moon casting a long silvery
highway over the rippling water around.</p>

<p>Where was he? What had happened to him? He tried
to sit up, and felt very sick, stiff, and sore, utterly confused
and helpless. He did not seem to care for his condition, or
even to wonder at it. Existence alone was enough for
him. Enough?&mdash;too much, for hysteria overcame him;
he hid his face and cried like a child.</p>

<p>Baffled on every side, everything lost but life&mdash;even that
imperilled in the most desperate manner; surely God
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
must be against him, it was of no use to fight longer against
the pricks; better to lie there and die, rather than struggle
any more. Despair made of him its puppet at last. Was
it any good to pray?&mdash;did God hear him? Would God
answer his supplications? Was there a God of love and
mercy at all, when he was beaten back at every point
like this, however bravely he tried to bear up against misfortune?</p>

<p>He was ashamed of weeping, even though there was no
one to observe him; and it did but exhaust him further,
yet it was a relief too. His tears were soon spent, and he
sat, forlorn and dejected, gazing in a purposeless way before
him, taking no heed to what he saw.</p>

<p>But gradually the extreme beauty of the scene forced
itself upon his mental vision. The hills, covered with rich
masses of woods, were black against the clear opal sky,
where the moon reigned in her pure loveliness. The
shadows of these hills lay deep on the translucent waters,
except where the broken rocks stood picturesquely above
them, and changed their duskiness to pearly foam. The
stars were reflected on the bosom of the river wherever it
was sufficiently still; and a herd of hog-deer issued from
a clearing of the jungle, and stooped their graceful heads
to drink just where the moonlight fell on them.</p>

<p>The clear whistle of some night-bird was heard and
answered from a neighbouring thicket, "Did you do it? Did
you do it?" they cried in turn, and the rippling water made
a gentle accompaniment to their song.</p>

<p>"I will lift up mine eyes to the hills, whence cometh
my help," was borne in upon Ralph's heart, and his longdrawn
sobs ceased.</p>

<p>Up sprang the sun, and touched the tops of the hills
with golden glory. Colour and warmth flashed over the
landscape, and brought comfort to his chilled frame. What
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
was that something glittering brightly between the trees?
It was no natural object&mdash;the outline was too regular, too
hard; it was the work of man's hand, for it was gilt,&mdash;it
was, yes, it was a pagoda! Man had erected that building,&mdash;his
fellow-men must be near at hand. Thank God! thank
God!</p>

<p>He rose, and sought to unstiffen his cramped limbs with
exercise, and the sun warmed him.</p>

<p>On the narrow strip of shingle where he had been cast
up, a human waif and stray, lay a small bundle. Ralph
looked at it, stooped over it, and lifted it from the wet
stones. It was his little package of orchids, safely bound
up as he had arranged it; which, slight thing as it was,
had safely stood the wreck of all else, and lay stranded
at his feet none the worse for its immersion.</p>

<p>Ralph almost laughed to see it. "You foolish things,"
thought he, "could nothing of greater value to me have
been spared for me. Can <i>you</i> feed me, clothe me, save me,
take me to my friends, do <i>anything</i> for me?"</p>

<p>He spurned them with his foot in irritation. Even his
knife, his one precious possession, was gone; his garments
hung in shreds upon him; there was nothing to eat upon
the islet; and this ridiculous bundle of plants, good for
nothing but to gratify the whimsical taste of a rich man,
was intact.</p>

<p>Then his mood changed, and he took it up in his hands
again. Between the crevices of the bark and moss he saw
one tiny delicate floweret pushing its fragile head out, and
seeming to smile at him.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," he said, "just to think of this! Come,
then, if God so made the grass of the field, shall He not
much more care for you, oh ye of little faith?" He
readjusted the loop of string, and passed it again round
his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he tried to think how he might reach the mainland,
where that pagoda glimmered like a hand beckoning
to him, but he could not devise any plan.</p>

<p>He was too weary and spent to attempt swimming in
that powerful current; he had no means of making a
second raft, or helping himself in any way; there were
neither bamboos nor lianas on this scrap of land.</p>

<p>He sat down close to the edge of the water, and rested
his chin in his hands, gazing straight before him. He must
sit there till he died; what else remained for him to do?
He thought of his mother, of Agnes, of his brothers and
little sisters. How grieved they all would be when the
news went home to them. But would it ever go home?
No, not one of his friends would know how he had struggled,
how he had failed, where he had died. No one would visit his
grave, or weep over his remains. The crows and the vultures
would fight over his carcase, and leave his bones to blanch
there, unburied. For him no funeral service, no hallowed
ground, no holy hymn.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" he cried aloud, "have I deserved this?
If this is the end of my short life, am I fit to go before Thee
on Thy judgment throne, and confidently crave for mercy?
What have I done so wicked as to merit this? Tell me,
oh my Father, and let me repent."</p>

<p>So he sat, until, his eyes gazing mournfully straight before
him, he became aware of some objects moving through the
jungle on the mainland. They came in single file, carrying
some large burden. Then one ran from the rear, past the
others, and gave directions, waving a long lean arm and
gesticulating.</p>

<p>No animals would conduct themselves so, they must be
men! Gracious Providence grant that they be men!</p>

<p>They moved steadily forward among the thinning trees
to the very margin of the river, and were plainly to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
perceived. Native Burmese! Fishermen, bearing a large
net, which they were preparing to cast into the water, and
draw up stream.</p>

<p>Ralph's voice failed him from revulse of feeling, he
thought that he should choke. He sprang to his feet, tore
off the last rags upon him, twisted them round a stick, and
waved them in the air.</p>

<p class="pmb3">They were not perceived,&mdash;no notice was taken. He
stooped to the water, drank from the hollow of his hand, his
tongue was unloosed, he cast water precipitately over head
and face, stood erect once more, clear from the undergrowth,
in the plashy shallows, waved his flag with the
energy of despair, and shouted with all his might&mdash;"Ahoy!
Ahoy! Ahoy!"</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />

<small>KIRKE AND DENHAM MEET</small></h2>


<p>Ralph forgot every language but his native English in the
desperate excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>"Halloa! Ahoy!" he vociferated, without knowing
what he called; but, to his great astonishment, the reply
was no Burmese "Ameh!" (mother) the universal exclamation
among the natives of that country upon every
occasion.</p>

<p>No, one figure started violently, turned sharply round,
lifted a hand to shade its eyes, with a gesture strangely
familiar, and an English voice, equally strange and equally
familiar, responded, "Halloa! Ahoy!" to his cry.</p>

<p>A great bustle was apparent, immediately, among the
little party of fishermen. Some ran off by the path which
had brought them there, evidently under direction from
the leader of the party; some busied themselves in launching
a little canoe, which Ralph had not previously discerned,
being hid by overhanging bushes; and two men, putting off
in it, prepared to ferry it across to the island.</p>

<p>Well was it that Ralph had not attempted to swim across
that stream. These were lusty fellows, but all their strength
was needed to row against it. The man who had answered
Denham's call in English words, was one of the two; and
Ralph stared hard at him as the canoe drew near.</p>

<p>There was something familiar in the attitude and movements,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
but the head was covered with a mass of curly
black hair, while a forest of dark whisker, beard, and
moustache concealed the lower part of the face, and flowed
over the hairy breast. The dress was made of the same
material as that of the natives,&mdash;a dark blue cloth, patterned
with wavy black lines; but it differed in shape, consisting
of a pair of loose trousers gathered into a waistband, and
confined there with a coloured handkerchief, just such as
young men in England tie over their cricketing flannels.
A loose cotton jacket, open at the chest, and leaving the
arms bare, was worn above this,&mdash;an outlandish costume,
yet manly, and not unbecoming. It was also of European
fashion, clearly betraying that its wearer was no native of
that country.</p>

<p>"I never saw that fellow before," thought Ralph, "yet
somehow I seem to know him."</p>

<p>The canoe drew nearer, the rower looked back over his
shoulder, uttered a loud cry, and, flinging down his oar,
sprang to his feet with the exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good God! Denham! Is it possible?"</p>

<p>Recognition came in the same instant.</p>

<p>"Kirke!" cried Ralph.</p>

<p>Nearly a year had elapsed since the two had met, but
Ralph, being two or three years younger than Kirke, and of
fairer complexion, had not altered so much, neither had he
been living so long in the wilds out of reach of barber and
other civilised influences.</p>

<p>Overjoyed on each side to meet with an Englishman,
an accustomed face, they clasped each other's hands
with eager greeting at the first impulse, forgetful of all
ill-will, but Kirke drew back the next minute and hung
his head.</p>

<p>"It is good of you to take my hand, Denham," said he.
"Can you forgive me all I did and tried to do to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not properly know what that was," said Ralph
joyously. "I have never understood why you did not like
me, nor believed half the others wanted to make out; but I
am ever so glad to see you now."</p>

<p>"And you can forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Anything, everything, if you will only help me to get
out of this place."</p>

<p>"Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite alone. I missed my party, and am lost. I
have been wandering in the jungle for many days, and was
starving."</p>

<p>"And in <i>that</i> state? A literal Baresarker costume."</p>

<p>"Even so."</p>

<p>"Come along, I can do something to remedy <i>that</i>, at anyrate."</p>

<p>He hurried Ralph into the canoe, spoke a few words to
his companion, and began to pull back to the mainland
with great energy.</p>

<p>Arrived upon the shore, he despatched one of the
Burmans for assistance, and the man scuttled off, grinning
with immense goodwill; while the rest jabbered around
the two strangers as they proceeded towards the village,
where half the inhabitants were bustling about in eager
hospitality.</p>

<p>Rice and fish were brought, plantains, pickled tea, cocoanuts
and green ginger. Kirke mounted into his dwelling,
and produced a garb similar to his own; and offered cheroots,
which however Ralph did not accept.</p>

<p>He devoured the food with the appetite of a growing boy
who had not tasted food for twenty-four hours; and Kirke
piled up the bowl from which he ate whenever its contents
shrank beneath the rim.</p>

<p>"Hold hard!" cried Ralph at last, "even I am gorged
and can eat no more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then tell me how you came here, and all that you have
done since I saw you," said Kirke.</p>

<p>"As to all that I have been doing, that would be a long
tale to tell," replied Ralph; "but, shortly put, I have been
going about the country with Mr. Gilchrist, getting plants
for Mr. Herford&mdash;orchids chiefly. We have not only got the
things bodily to send home, but made drawings, whenever
we could, of anything rare or special. About a fortnight ago
we fell in with some wild elephants in a lonely place, and, in
escaping from an old bull that had been turned out of the
herd, as we fancied, I got separated from the rest of them,
and met with a family party of tigers&mdash;papa, mamma, and
offspring. I had to cut my lucky again; and, somehow,
between the two adventures, lost my way, and could not
find any of the fellows I was with. After roaming about,
up hill and down dale, till I found that I was really befogged
in the wilderness, it seemed the best thing I could
do was to follow down the first water-course I could find, in
hopes of coming somewhere in time. So I managed to
knock up a gimcrack sort of a kind of raft, that served my
turn as well as a better, till the rapids here broke it all to
smithereens, and landed me yonder; where I must have
died if you had not picked me off."</p>

<p>"I should think you had about enough of rafts by this
time," said Kirke sadly.</p>

<p>"I have not had enough of friends in need," replied
Ralph.</p>

<p>"You are a real good fellow, Denham," said the other,
reaching out his hand to him. "I have wanted this long
time to tell you how sorry I am for all that took place in
the poor old <i>Pelican</i>, and to ask your forgiveness for my
conduct to you. I was a bad messmate, a bad man in every
way; but I see things differently now, and would do anything
I knew of to redeem the past, if only I could see how.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
I did cut that rope, in a fit of mad jealousy, and repented
of it as soon as it was done. I have suffered much from
remorse since."</p>

<p>"That you repented as soon as you had done it, showed
that you were not wholly bad at heart," said Ralph.
"Don't say any more to me about it, Kirke. If you have
made your peace with God, there is no need for me to preach,
you know. Let us be friends in the future."</p>

<p>The two young men shook hands heartily, and Kirke felt
happier than he had hoped ever to be again. He took
Denham into the hut where he lived, and found him a mat
to lie upon, the most luxurious bed upon which Ralph had
stretched himself for many days. He was soon wrapped in
the sweetest of slumbers thereon.</p>

<p>Sleep lasted till far into the next day, for he was quite
worn out, and his quarters were fairly comfortable. When
he awoke, he found Kirke watching him with grave earnest
eyes, which brightened into a smile in response to Ralph's
joyous greeting.</p>

<p>A good wash was Denham's first demand that morning;
and when he had thus refreshed himself, he was indued into a
suit of light garments such as Kirke wore, of European
fashion, though constructed from native cloth; and then
attacked the cold breakfast awaiting him.</p>

<p>"It is ever so good of you to provide me like this, Kirke,"
said he. "A fellow must have been reduced as low as I
was to appreciate properly the comfort of being 'clothed
and in one's right mind.' But how you come to be living
here like this, is a mystery to me."</p>

<p>"You need have no scruples," replied Kirke. "My
people at home are well-to-do folks, and I always had plenty
of money. I had it in a belt that I always wore, and
this helped me to get off from Moulmein, for it was chiefly
in gold, and the Burmese understand English gold. I have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
some shots in the locker yet, for living is cheap in these
wilds, and I have been ill, so have not wanted a great deal.
I made up my mind to stay here till the rice harvest is
gathered, for it might then be possible to get a passage to
Rangoon, when they take it to market there. Once in
Rangoon, I can always get supplies from home again; and,
indeed, have a couple of English banknotes that will take
me along for a time. Don't have any scruples as to having
a little from me. You are safe to fall in with your people
again in Rangoon, or the Herford's branch there would
advance to you, even if you do not believe that I owe to
you a debt that money will never replace."</p>

<p>"You are very generous," said Ralph, "and I am thankful
to meet with anyone who both can and will help me.
I know that I should be able to repay you in Rangoon, if we
ever reach that place; so, meantime, thank you kindly.
How long do you reckon it will be before the harvest will
be ready?"</p>

<p>"Well, the rice is growing ripe. Look there, they have
stuck up those beautiful erections all about lately."</p>

<p>In effect, there were three or four stages, fixed about
fifteen feet above the ground, in different places. Each of
these erections was of a size to accommodate a squatting
Burman, smoking happily, with a bowl of rice and a jar of
water by his side. Every now and then he gave a tug at
a string, which communicated with a machinery of simple
nature, consisting of bamboos, feathers and twine in endless
ramifications, all set fluttering by the pull. This, and an
unearthly screech uttered at the same moment, aroused a
cloud of little green parrots that were feeding upon the
rice. They fluttered and squalled in unison with the
fluttering and squalling of the native, and all creation was
lively. Then the Burman sank again into meditation upon
the life of Guadama, or into slumber, or whatever he
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
pleased to call it; the parrots went back to their feast,
and all proceeded quietly until the watchman's sense of
duty once more impelled him to exertion.</p>

<p>"We shall cut all that the birds condescend to leave us
soon now," said Kirke. "In the meantime the fishery is
going on, and the preparation of 'ngapé'! Can't you smell
the stinking stuff on the breeze? Faugh!"</p>

<p>"I hope we may get a passage in a boat which carries
rice alone," said Ralph, with a face of disgust. "How can
the Burmese eat that disgusting stuff!"</p>

<p>The preparation of this favourite dainty in the Burmese
commissariat, which is manufactured chiefly from rotten fish
pounded up into a paste with various condiments, poisoned
the air. Prawns are the favourite fish used, but there were
none in this place.</p>

<p>Such secluded valleys as that into which Kirke had
strayed, are great homes of this industry, for the fish come
up into them in huge swarms to spawn, and are left behind,
in the lakes and pools, when the hot season dries up much
of the super-abundant water. To catch them is then easy,
and the trade a profitable one.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Kirke, "we won't go in one of those boats!
Trust Jamie Kirke for that. Sooner than be stunk out of
life like that, we will imitate the Welsh young lady's forefathers
in the Flood, and have a boat of our own. We could
sell it again in Rangoon. I don't know whether, now that
you are here to help me, it would not be as well to cross
these plains, and get a boat for ourselves on the Sittoung
River. We could navigate it easily between us if we were
careful about the bore."</p>

<p>"That would be very jolly," said Ralph. "I and my
cargo," pointing to his precious bundle of orchids. "My
cargo will not overburden you, I should be loath to part
with it now, having brought it through so much peril that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
I almost have a superstitious feeling that it consists of my
'luck.' We should be more help than hindrance to you."</p>

<p>"You talk of superstitious feelings, Denham, but there is
only a slight boundary between faith and superstition. I
should not call it <i>superstition</i> on my own part to believe
that you had been sent by Providence to me, in answer to
prayer for forgiveness and help."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," replied Ralph gravely. "God
does lead us in mysterious ways, and it is among these
wonderful places that one learns to believe in what He
can perform. We have seen strange things, both of us,
since we left the humdrum Liverpool streets."</p>

<p>"Perhaps He was as plainly to be met with there, if we
had but opened our eyes to note His footprints. Here we
are shaken out of our own common jogtrot ways,&mdash;waked
up,&mdash;have had our everyday husks peeled off, and are
brought face to face with nature in its marvellous sublimity
and simplicity."</p>

<p>The two young men sat silently after this, watching
the movements of a couple of girls, whose occupation had
suggested Kirke's simile.</p>

<p>They crouched upon their heels, one on either side of a
handmill, in which they were husking "paddy," or rice in
the original state, for the next family meal.</p>

<p>The handmill consisted of two hollow wooden receptacles,
the upper one furnished with two handles, by which the
girls worked it half round to the right and back to the
left. This threw the grain through the grooved sides into
the lower vessel, grinding the chaff off on its way. From
the lower bowl it escaped to the floor through a hole in
the bottom.</p>

<p>From the heap thus accumulated, a child emptied the
rice into baskets, pouring it from one into another until
the husk was fairly well winnowed from it; and then threw
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
it into a mortar, sunk into the ground, and in which a
heavy pestle worked by means of a long lever affixed to it,
upon the end of which a graceful maiden was balancing
herself, thus working it up and down to the time of a
monotonous song which she chanted to herself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! rice ka la! come!<br /></span>
<span class="i05">Oh! rice ka la! come!<br /></span>
<span class="i05">Mee Meht calls you, come, come!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rice grain gleamed white as pearls from among the
dusky chaff as she worked; and ever and anon, with some
joke from one or the other, the girlish voices bubbled over
into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"They seem happy," said Ralph.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Ay, they do," Kirke replied, "but they are like animals,&mdash;<i>they</i>
do not 'look before and after.'"</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />

<small>FIGHT WITH DACOITS</small></h2>


<p>Neither a boat in which to descend the river, nor a bullock-cart
in which to reach its banks, were to be hired until
the harvest was ready, so there was nothing for it but
patience.</p>

<p>Neither Kirke nor Ralph felt themselves quite strong
enough to be inclined for excessive haste. Kirke's illness,
and Denham's sufferings in the jungle, made a little further
rest still desirable before running the risk of more danger
and new fatigues. They therefore remained quietly in the
village contentedly enough, learning to know each other
and like each other better every day.</p>

<p>They had long conversations, discussions of every subject
which occurred to them. Each had undergone a training
so different from the other that they never saw any matter
in exactly the same light, and their opposite experiences
were mutually valuable. Kirke's deep and dark knowledge
of life was a warning to Denham; his own boyish lightness
and gaiety were encouraging to his friend.</p>

<p>Meantime the rice ripened, was cut, and put up in stooks,
ready for the threshing floor, in true scriptural fashion; for
the manner of husking it by hand, as before described, was
too slow and costly to be practised upon large quantities;
neither was the paddy grained at all for mercantile purposes,
as machinery was so much more convenient for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Much rice, indeed, is brought to England in the form of
paddy; and cleaned there by steam mills, of which there
are many in Liverpool and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the valley where Ralph and Kirke found themselves,
it was a prosperous year. The people had been able to
buy a sufficiency of excellent young plants, the weather
had been favourable to their growth, the yield was good&mdash;the
strangers had brought them luck.</p>

<p>But was it good or bad luck that the report of their
riches should have gone forth over the land, and created
envy in the hearts of some among their neighbours&mdash;idler,
poorer, less fortunate than they?</p>

<p>But so it was. Down from the wild hillside came a
party of four or five men from a neighbouring outlying
village, armed with guns and pistols. They crept along,
hidden by boulder and rock; crawling through gulley, and
channels of dried-up streamlets, to reconnoitre; to judge
of the wealth in the village, and the exact moment when
it could be seized upon to the greatest advantage.</p>

<p>Dacoity, as it is called, is the great curse of the hill and
jungle parts of Burma. The Burman hates hard work&mdash;it
is so much easier to help himself to his neighbour's rice
than to grow it for himself. If his crop fails, why should
another man have more than he wants? Down he comes
in the night, sets the village on fire, kills the men, carries
off the maidens, and appropriates the property.</p>

<p>The English law is severe upon the dacoit, but, at the
time when Ralph Denham was wandering about in these
wild regions, British Burma consisted only of a long strip
of seaboard, backed by a mountain-range which divided
it from Siam, and of the rice-growing lands in Pegu,
formed by the widespread delta of the Irriwaddy River.</p>

<p>It was very easy for ill-doers to escape over the borders
of the British possessions either to the east or north, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
English law could not reach them. Law and order elsewhere
was conspicuous by its absence, therefore the dacoit
flourished.</p>

<p>The English authorities set a price upon these robbers'
heads, so it was short shrift for them if caught. To avoid
this unpleasantness, they killed their enemies whenever
they found that this procedure suited their convenience;
and, in order to deter pursuit, they endeavoured to strike
terror into the hearts of those who might seek to apprehend
them, by a peculiar refinement of cruelty in the manner
of killing them. Thus they were not nice people to meet
with&mdash;far from it.</p>

<p>The two young men were sitting together, in the cool
of the evening, upon the raised platform which ran round
their hut, and formed a verandah, roofed with thekkee,&mdash;a
kind of dried grass,&mdash;but open on every side to the air.
There had been a magnificent sunset, whose gorgeousness
had yet hardly faded from the western sky. They had been
talking, but the soothing influence of the hour was upon
them and they were silent now.</p>

<p>Soft curls of smoke wafted away from Kirke's cheroot;
and Ralph sat on a mat, leaning against the bamboo support
of the verandah, gazing dreamily over the landscape before
him.</p>

<p>Ralph's vision was very keen, and he now became aware
of three or four men, dimly perceptible among the gathering
shadows, creeping along the river-bank, stooping low to be
thus better concealed by the reeds which grew upon it.</p>

<p>Their movements were suspicious, and he quietly called
Kirke's attention to them. Kirke could not see them, and
thought that Ralph had imagined their presence.</p>

<p>"No," said Denham, "it is not imagination; they move
a short way, and then keep quite still for a full minute or
more. It is that which makes me think that they are up
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
to mischief. Fix your eye upon that clump of reeds the
farthest to the left of four. Now, there, don't you see
something come out from behind it?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I do," exclaimed Kirke. "One, two, three, four,
five things. They are men's heads, as sure as a gun! Ralph,
it strikes me that this means dacoity."</p>

<p>"I believe it does," replied Ralph. "There is a large
sledge there laden with paddy. The beggars are after that
to a certainty."</p>

<p>"Have at them!" cried Kirke. "Don't let us allow their
knavish tricks to succeed."</p>

<p>"Halt," replied Ralph. "Those fellows have guns, and
long swords or daggers. There are other things stuck into
their waistbelts, which are either pistols or knives, perhaps
both. Have we weapons at hand? There are five of them,
we two could do little against them alone; we had better
call up old Shway Poh, and some of the villagers, to help."</p>

<p>"Moung Shway Poh won't be of much use. He will talk
resignedly of those scamps being the 'five enemies,' or the
'five duties,' or the 'five great acts of sacrifice.' That rice
is not his, he will be perfectly resigned to the thieves
annexing it."</p>

<p>"We must use a little gentle force then, to persuade him
that one of the ten precepts is to preserve your neighbour's
goods when you accept authority over him. Shway Poh
did not get this village to eat just to keep his own rice safe,
or his own skin either. But, Kirke, it is not only that lot
of rice which the beggars want. They may be short of
food, and mean to have that, but what they are <i>really</i> after
is the village wealth, the ornaments which the women wear,
the money in the monastery, the valuables generally. The
important thing is to beat them off there, before they creep
into the village to find out what the people have."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right. Some of those girls wear
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
really magnificent jewellery at their festivals; and it seems
to me that they sport more and more of late. Even that
little Sunshine child came out the other day in a pair of
ruby earrings that might make a duchess' mouth water. So
here goes. I bought these guns only last week for our
journey. They are not first-rate ones, but serviceable. And
here is a good bowie-knife for you, and one for me. Now
for Mr. Golden Grandfather."</p>

<p>They found the head man of the village, who rejoiced in
that lovely name, squatted with his family around a huge
tray of rice and chillies, flavoured with oil and salt. He
was shovelling his supper into his mouth with vast relish,
and was extremely averse to exertion, having already
gobbled up so much as to make movement inconvenient.</p>

<p>"The Englishman mistakes," he said. "Dacoits never
come here. They know well that I am a Friday's child,
fierce and passionate as the tusked elephant which protects
my soul. They dare not incur my wrath. The village is
safe as long as I am its chief."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> fierce and passionate?" cried his wife contemptuously.
"So you may be, but your fierceness is like
the flame of a chaff fire, it flares up easily and is out again
in one minute. Did we slave and labour for our beautiful
jewels simply to give them to the thief? No indeed.
Show me, golden<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> youth, where the dacoits are to be seen.
Will they be content with one sledge full if they are down
upon us, Poh Pyin?<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Answer me that."</p>

<p>She went out into the verandah, but the house was
situated behind a grove of trees which hid the rice-sledge
from her sight.</p>

<p>"We must go in the boats," said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then go armed," implored Ralph, "for the robbers
are armed to the teeth."</p>

<p>"You are sure?" asked she.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Ralph.</p>

<p>She called up some of the men; and the village chief
having now plucked up a little energy, a boat was prepared,
and put off across the stream.</p>

<p>So much time was lost, however, that the robbers had
already linked two sledges together, and were punting them
away with all speed. Upon seeing the villagers' boat, which
was impelled by six men, gaining rapidly upon them, and followed
by two more, they pointed their guns at the foremost.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" they cried, "or we fire."</p>

<p>"We had better return," whispered the fat old Shway Poh.</p>

<p>"Coward!" hissed out Kirke, thirsting for the fray.
"What! they are but five."</p>

<p>"They are desperate men," whined Shway Poh.</p>

<p>"If we lose our rice, there is nothing but dacoity before
us, ourselves, next winter," said one of the men.</p>

<p>The boat shot ahead, and tried to run athwart the first
sledge. The dacoits fired. Had five guns really been able
to kill six men? There were five rowers, and Shway Poh
steering. Ralph had the sixth oar, and Kirke's gun rang
out in response to the attack, but only he and Denham
remained steady at their posts. All the Burmans were
bowled over. Strange that the dacoits' shots should have
hit them all, and missed Kirke's broad figure standing erect
in the bows. Did he bear a charmed life?</p>

<p>There was another explanation of the mystery. He who
fights and runs away, may always live to fight another day.
The six Burmans were all prostrate at the bottom of the
boat, and the shots had passed harmlessly above them.
Neither had they been taken with very true aim, for all
had gone wide of the mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>A kick from Kirke aroused the man nearest to him.</p>

<p>"Get up, you scoundrel!" thundered the young man.
"What are you funking there for? Seize them before they
can reload!"</p>

<p>He threw himself out of the boat, which had now crossed
the stream, and tore the pole from the hands of one dacoit.
Ralph followed, and seized another by the throat, but the
fellow's body was thickly besmeared with cocoanut oil,
rendering him so slippery that he actually slid through
his hands, and Denham's foot slipped, throwing him
down.</p>

<p>Up he sprang in an instant, and tried to grasp the fellow's
garments; but, with a wriggle and a twist, he was out of the
coiled cloth in one moment, leaving it in Ralph's hands,
while he stood for the space of a second, free of all impedimenta,
then bounded into the jungle.</p>

<p>Ralph gave chase, but had no chance against the lithe
limbs of the Burman, well used to such encounters, and
almost as supple as a snake. After a short pursuit, he turned
back to assist his friends, seeing the undesirability of separating
their party into single units.</p>

<p>He found himself needed. Upon the report of firearms,
the natives in the other two boats held aloof, and were now
returning to the village, towing, however, the rice sledges
with them; and the valorous Mr. Golden Grandfather was
in the act of stepping into their own, with evident purpose
of following in their wake.</p>

<p>Kirke had knocked down one of the dacoits, who was
either killed or lay senseless on the ground. Using his
long pole as a quarter-staff, and whirling it round his head
in true old English style, he was making play against
another, who, wholly unused to this style of thing, was
defenceless in his hands.</p>

<p>But the fourth was in the act of coming up behind Kirke
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
with a knife in his muscular hands,&mdash;a long curved knife of
deadly power&mdash;and actually had it raised in air, ready to
plunge into the young man's back, beneath the shoulderblade.
Ralph caught his own dagger from his cummerbund,
and dashed upon the enemy's rear, with a cry of "'Ware,
Kirke!"</p>

<p>Kirke turned, saw his danger, and faced it. Ralph
plunged his dagger at the dacoit, who raised his arm to
protect his head, and received the blow in the fleshy part
of it. The fifth robber crawled up through the long grass,
and wounded Ralph in the leg, bringing him to the ground;
but Ralph caught his first opponent by the ankle as he lay,
holding him there with a grasp of iron, and brought him
down over him.</p>

<p>Kirke's guns had been left in the boat, unfortunately; but
the two English lads had given the dacoits no time to reload
theirs, so that the fight was pretty equal. Now, however,
Mr. Grandfather, regarding himself as tolerably safe, began
to blaze away from the boat to the assistance of his guests,
and the tide of battle turned.</p>

<p>The dacoits evidently thought this too long odds, and fled,
leaving one of their number behind. Kirke turned him over
with his foot, as the others disappeared, and found him quite
dead,&mdash;an ugly sight, with his dark, evil, scowling face set
in the ashy hue of death.</p>

<p>"Pah!" cried Kirke. "What carrion!"</p>

<p>"Poor wretch," said the gentler Denham, "I am very
sorry for him."</p>

<p>"Dacoit will revenge this upon some of us," said Mr.
Golden Grandfather. "This is a bad job for us."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, old fellow," said Kirke lightly. "The dacoits
have had enough of us for one while, and we will be prepared
for them before they come again. The rice is safe
at anyrate, that is one good thing. You must get it down
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
to the creek with all speed. It would be the best way to
set off to-morrow with morning light."</p>

<p>"Yes, paya, you speak truth; but this bad job," reiterated
Moung Shway Poh.</p>

<p>The party returned silently to the village, there was no
exultation over their victory, all were exhausted now the
excitement was over, several had been more or less knocked
about, and Ralph had lost a good deal of blood from a flesh
wound in his leg.</p>

<p class="pmb3">One of the women dressed it with some healing leaves,
binding it up, and they all retired to rest, but the women
as well as the men were inclined to look darkly upon the
transactions of the evening, under the belief that though
their treasures were the original inducement for the dacoits'
arrival, those scoundrels would now never rest until they
had avenged blood by blood.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />

<small>THE DACOITS BURN THE VILLAGE</small></h2>


<p>Moung Shway Poh retired to his virtuous sleeping-mat,
and sought peaceful oblivion among his family. The other
villagers also separated, each to his place, and the two
English lads went to their hut.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is anything in what the grandfather
says, Kirke?" asked Ralph anxiously.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt but what the dear old sinner's
experience of his kind is exhaustive, and the ladies seem
to echo his idea," replied Kirke. "But I should think
that the beggars had got enough for to-night. They will
want to pull themselves a little together before they make
a fresh attack. We may sleep the sleep of the just for a
few hours, my boy."</p>

<p>"It would be just as well to load the guns, and see that
our other things are all to hand, though," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Careful and provident youth! Perhaps you are right,"
quoth Kirke.</p>

<p>Accordingly they examined their weapons, prepared and
laid them to hand, ate their suppers, and stretched themselves
on their mats. Kirke was asleep in five minutes, but
Ralph's wound began to throb and ache, and the distress
from it kept him awake. He was feverish too, and twisted
and turned on his bed, unable to find ease in any posture.
Now he thought he heard stealthy movements around him;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
then he lost consciousness for a few moments, and awoke
with a start, fancying that a snake was crawling over him,
or that he was once again confronted by a leopard's glaring
eyes.</p>

<p>He told himself over and over again that the sounds
were but the soft rustling of bats' wings, the scramble of
rats along the rafters of the hut, or the whirr of mosquitoes
in the damp night air.</p>

<p>It was of no use, sleep forsook his eyes, although he was so
tired that he longed for its balminess. Instead of finding its
refreshment, he was haunted by all the stories of dacoits
which he had heard at Moulmein and elsewhere.</p>

<p>He thought of one young lady who was said to have
been gently lifted from her bed, the mattress removed from
beneath her and appropriated, while she was replaced upon
the framework without being awakened.</p>

<p>He remembered how a gentleman, fancying he heard
sounds in the house, got up, and entangled his feet in
garments belonging to his wife lying about on the floor.</p>

<p>"What is that untidy ayah of yours about, to leave your
things scattered on the ground like this?" scolded he.</p>

<p>"She did not throw them down," said the lady; "I saw
her lay that habit on the chest of drawers, ready for me to
put on in the morning."</p>

<p>Her husband by this time had struck a light, and found
the whole chest of drawers gone. The servants were called
up, a search instituted, and the piece of furniture discovered
in the compound, rifled of all its contents.</p>

<p>He laughed to himself, for the fiftieth time, over the
remembrance of the doctor's wife, who awoke in the night
to see a dusky figure stooping over a nice, carefully-locked
mahogany box, in the act of lifting it to carry it away.</p>

<p>Being a brave woman, she sprang up into a sitting
posture, clapping her hands with a sudden sharp sound.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
The robber dropped his booty, leapt over the verandah,
swarmed down one of the posts which supported it, and
vanished in a moment. By this act of presence of mind,
she saved her husband's stomach-pump.</p>

<p>Other more gruesome anecdotes recurred to his memory
in wearisome procession, and murdered sleep as effectually
as Macbeth had ever done.</p>

<p>Hour passed after hour in this manner, but yet surely
it could not be daylight already? The sun was given to
springing rapidly up in these regions, but not with so
sudden a glow as this, nor with so brilliantly red a colour.
What was it?</p>

<p>Conviction flashed upon him at once, there was fire
somewhere.</p>

<p>"Kirke! Kirke!" he cried. "Up, man, the dacoits are
firing the village!"</p>

<p>Up sprang Kirke, and the two rushed out of their hut, to
see half a dozen of the pretty slight houses around them
blazing like torches, while demon figures leapt and howled
around, flinging burning brands upon the inflammable roofs
of palmy thekkee leaves, and in at the open doorways of
the slender bamboo and matted walls.</p>

<p>The wretched villagers, caught like rats in so many traps,
must either be burnt with their houses, or be chopped down
by the dahs carried by the merciless robbers. Man, woman,
and child,&mdash;all alike murdered in cold blood by their unsparing
hands.</p>

<p>The assassins were but a gang of four, therefore, probably,
was the same band as that which the villagers had beaten
off in the evening, with the loss of one; for the dacoit
generally works in parties of five.</p>

<p>It might well be supposed that a whole village, consisting
perhaps of fifty men, with women and young people, could
easily have repelled an attack from so small a party as that;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
but it must be understood that, to preserve the people
from the floods in the wet season, and the fear of wild
animals at all times, the houses were raised upon high
piles; each, therefore, being isolated completely from its
neighbour.</p>

<p>When the floods were out, one lady would take her boat
even to borrow a cheroot from her nearest friend; the
population lived in boats almost wholly; their houses were
little more than shelters in which to eat and sleep. They
contained no effects to induce a love for "home," in the
Englishman's understanding of the word,&mdash;few appliances for
occupation or pleasure. A chest or box for containing the
best clothes and ornaments; a sufficiency of mats and rugs
for beds; a "byat," or wooden dish, lacquered, from which
they eat their rice; a few little bowls to hold small quantities
of more tasty articles for flavouring the tasteless staple of
their food; and half a dozen earthen pots or jars,&mdash;these
form the sum total of a Burman's Lares and Penates; and
there is nothing among them to create "house-pride"
among the ladies, or a love for home-keeping in the gentlemen.
All their amusements and pleasures are taken out of
doors, in public.</p>

<p>But the family retires, at "sky shutting-in time," for
sleep; and the dacoit who means mischief can take them
practically one by one, burning the edifice, and destroying,
or watching, the means of descent from the little platform
upon which it is erected.</p>

<p>As Kirke and Ralph rushed out from their hut, they saw
the ground at the foot of the next one strewn with the
bleeding corpses of the father and three sons who dwelt
there, while the aged grandmother crouched shuddering
among the blazing rafters, and pretty little Miss Sunshine,
the gay, merry child who had played a hundred tricks upon
them, and laughed with them so often, clung to the kingpost,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
shrieking with terror, while the dacoits chopped and
mangled the bodies of her nearest and dearest friends, and
leapt up howling to reach her, and sweep her into the same
holocaust.</p>

<p>"Oh, paya, paya, save me!" she implored, stretching her
little hands towards them, the tears coursing down her
painted cheeks.</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Kirke; "the bloodthirsty scoundrels!"</p>

<p>He caught up his gun and fired, but the dacoits were
never still; they danced from place to place; they seemed
to be ubiquitous, there was no taking aim at any one of
them.</p>

<p>Well was it for the English lads that Ralph had loaded
the guns, and laid their pistols to hand. The steady fire
maintained by Kirke kept the dacoits at bay, they retired
to a little distance; and Ralph descended from their verandah
on the dark side, and put up a rough ladder for the girl and
old woman to come down.</p>

<p>Sunshine sprang quickly to it, but the old woman was
paralysed by fear and could not move.</p>

<p>"Escape, my pretty, into the jungle," whispered the boy
hurriedly to his little playmate, who needed no second
bidding to disappear into the darkness; while he ascended
the ladder, protected by Kirke's gun, took the aged crone
on his back, and essayed to return by the same means.</p>

<p>The charred bamboos crashed down as he seized the
woman; the burning thekkee on the roof set her clothes
on fire; she was a burden too heavy for his strength, he
could not carry her. The dacoits came running and howling
up once more,&mdash;once more did Kirke's gun roar out its
protecting voice, and a robber fell.</p>

<p>His companions rushed forward, and drew him back,&mdash;he
was hit in the thigh, and could not stand; the others
raged at a safe distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>All this took but a few minutes of time, and some of the
villagers now hurried up, and formed a circle around the
supports of Kirke's house; while one, another son of the
old woman, rushed up the ladder, and helped Ralph to
bring his mother down and seat her on the damp ground
beneath the verandah.</p>

<p>Several other women were brought in there also, the ring
of men encircling the place, prepared to fire or strike at the
dacoits if they ventured within reach. The long dahs,&mdash;sharp-edged
swords,&mdash;worn by the dacoits down their backs,
and drawn by both hands over the right shoulders, proved
to be deadly weapons, and the battle raged long, with
horrid outcry, and many a gaping wound; but the enemy
was beaten off at last, bleeding, baffled and exhausted,
scorched, maimed, and yet howling with rage and pain.</p>

<p>A second man of their party had been killed.</p>

<p>Ralph had forgotten his wounded leg in the recent
excitement; it was but a flesh wound, though a deep one.
With care and rest it would have been quite healed in a
few days, but the exertion which he had taken inflamed it
much.</p>

<p>It might be that the weapon with which he received the
hurt had rust, or some deleterious matter upon its blade;
but, however that might be, the place assumed a very ugly
appearance, and suppurated.</p>

<p>Kirke washed it well with warm water, applied fresh
leaves and bandages&mdash;what else to do he did not know, but
felt very uneasy, for in spite of the large quantity of blood
which his friend had lost, he grew so feverish at night.</p>

<p>The villagers who had been burnt out were dispersed
among the huts left standing. Kirke set a watch, and went
round from time to time to see that the watchmen did not
sleep at their posts. He had taken the command of the
hamlet, all appearing willing to submit to the leader who
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
had shown so much daring and courage; but his own heart
was heavy within him. Except Denham, he had no trust
in any one of his followers. The Burmese can be fierce by
spasmodic fits, but their natural temper is easy, pleasure-loving,
inert. There is in them none of the elements which
constitute a good soldier. They would rather fly than fight
at any time. If Denham were going to be seriously ill, he
had no reliance upon anyone, no friend to back him up.</p>

<p>He believed that the dacoits would certainly return for
vengeance, if not for the treasures. What would be the
end of it all?</p>

<p>He went his rounds, having to awaken one or two of his
watchers every time; he returned, to bathe Ralph's brow,
change the healing leaves, give him drink, and observe him
anxiously; then he went his rounds again. What a weary,
weary day it was, he could not keep up the strain long;
and, oh horror! suppose that Denham had been wounded
by a <i>poisoned</i> sword.</p>

<p>It was dark again; every hour full of danger. How could
he meet it? how overcome it?</p>

<p class="pmb3">However, about dawn Ralph's fever lessened, his skin
became cool and moist, and he fell asleep. That fear was off
his mind for the time, but the peril in which they stood had
by no means lessened.</p>


<p class="break" />

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>


<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />

<small>DESPERATION</small></h2>


<p>No, the peril was none the less to any of the villagers, and
greatly increased to the Englishmen, for the natives began
to look darkly at them.</p>

<p>Kirke had made them all leave their inflammable houses,
perched like dovecots high upon poles, and had encamped
in a little clearance at the edge of the jungle.</p>

<p>This he insisted upon enlarging to the best of their ability,
cutting down all cover beneath which the dacoits could steal
upon them unperceived. So dense was the scrub that this
was hard work, and the Burman hates hard work.</p>

<p>Kirke, with British energy, set the example himself,
hacking, hewing, and felling, with promptitude which was
far from being seconded. He caused the débris to be
built up around a circle, within which he entrenched
the women and children, with all the household effects that
could be gathered together, and would fain have thrown
up earthworks to the best of his ability, but the Burmans
would not dig them out.</p>

<p>He insisted upon the houses which remained being cut
down from their elevations, lest the dacoits should succeed
in mounting to them, and firing down upon the camp; and
this annoyed the short-sighted owners more than anything
else.</p>

<p>"Why should we destroy our houses?" they said. "The
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
dacoits are gone now. We have given them the fire to eat,
and they have had enough of it. We wear the charm
against fire and sword, the blessed nats will protect us, ours
are stronger than theirs; and the houses must be put up
again before the next flood-time comes."</p>

<p>"True," argued Kirke, "but meantime you may be all
killed. The dacoits are certain to return, perhaps in much
greater force. They will come determined to avenge the
deaths of their friends, and they also wear charms. You
must take measures for your own safety. Cannot you get
help from any neighbours strong enough to protect you?
Is there no English station within reach? Could no scout
be sent to any British police-station, to tell them of our
need and beg assistance? There must be some such place.
Cannot we send word to Rangoon?"</p>

<p>The Burmans looked at each other. They knew well
enough that there was a police-station within twenty
miles of them, but they had concealed the fact from
Kirke because they wanted his money. He had brought
prosperity to them, and they did not want to lose him.
He had proved to be a perfect godsend to them hitherto;
but it was plain to them that the reputation of this very
prosperity had partly caused the dacoits to assail them.</p>

<p>Would it be best for them now to keep the Englishmen
with them longer, and fight the robbers themselves, or to
make capital out of helping them to return to their friends,
who, out of gratitude, would come and kill the dacoits for
them?</p>

<p>The question was hotly debated in the village conclave.</p>

<p>Moung Shway Poh was jealous of Kirke's ascendency.
He felt his authority tottering on its throne. Kirke spoke
to him in a dictatorial tone, and ordered him about just as
if he had been the veriest child, still untattooed; and the
old man hated him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have the strangers with us," said he, "just as much
as if we sent to the station and had the officers, who would
bring good guns, big guns, kill the thieves, and save our
houses. They would give us rewards for helping their
countrymen; pay for the dacoits' heads&mdash;be a revenue to us
for all next year. We should have plenty of rice, plenty of
smoke, plenty of everything from them. This man has
spent all he has now, he cannot have much left; and
the boy has nothing at all, though he must eat and be
clothed."</p>

<p>But the other side was represented by the sons of the
man who was cut down and mutilated by the cruel dahs
of the dacoits,&mdash;by the children of the poor woman who,
with her infant, had shared in her husband's fate, and
whose grandmother and little sister had been saved by
Ralph.</p>

<p>Other victims had also fallen, and their relations thirsted
to avenge blood by blood. They were eager to kill the
dacoits themselves. To them, in that case, would belong
the glory; to them would the butterfly spirits of the
victims be grateful; to them would the price of the dacoits'
heads be paid, which would be lost to them if the police
shot them instead.</p>

<p>Kirke, having superintended all the defences which he
could prevail upon the Burmans to make, sat by the side of
Ralph, who was sleeping profoundly on his mat, and
watched the council&mdash;debating at a little distance&mdash;with
great anxiety.</p>

<p>He knew well what issues were under discussion; he had
gauged the characters of these men accurately during his
residence with them, and was convinced that they would
treat him like an orange which had been sucked dry, and
of which the rind was only flung away.</p>

<p>He could have escaped by himself, and his resources,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
though nearly exhausted, were not yet quite at an end.
He had enough left to hire or purchase a tat,<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or pay for
a passage in the big rice boat, and so make his way to
an English settlement, where he could take his chance
of punishment for his conduct on board the <i>Pelican</i>, and
await remittances from home.</p>

<p>Since meeting with Denham, his apprehensions of the
consequences of his crime had dwindled down. No lives
had been lost, much time had elapsed, and he had been
of material service to Ralph. He was assured by Ralph
that Mr. Gilchrist wished him no harm, and would prove
placable.</p>

<p>But it would be better for him to give himself up, rather
than to be taken prisoner by English police; he would
much prefer making his own way to Rangoon to being sent
there as a captive.</p>

<p>Yet he could not abandon Ralph, who was in no state for
a hurried journey taken under the difficulties which must
attend an escape. Even now the boy was muttering and
rambling in his sleep, the fever was rising higher with the
approach of nightfall, and the wound in his leg was
terribly inflamed. Kirke changed the dressing, bathed it
and Ralph's head and face with cool water, and changed his
hot pillow. Ralph looked gratefully up at him as he woke
up completely.</p>

<p>"You are very good to me, old fellow," said he. "I am
sorry to be such a nuisance; but, somehow, I feel very stiff
and queer, and my head rages."</p>

<p>"All right," said Kirke, a lump rising in his throat as he
gazed upon his friend, so dear to him now. "All right,
we will win through this worry soon. You are better."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm better," said Ralph, with a mighty effort at
cheerfulness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>"Drink this," said Kirke, offering some water to him;
"go to sleep again, there is nothing else to be done, and
I'm watching."</p>

<p>Ralph drank the water, and soon fell into a calmer,
more refreshing, slumber.</p>

<p>Kirke went to examine his store of ammunition, and
became graver than ever, for he found that it was running
extremely short. There was no method by which he might
replenish his powder; but the dacoits, with the whole
country behind them, could get practically inexhaustible
supplies.</p>

<p>Kirke heaved a sigh, and sat down once more by the
sleeping boy.</p>

<p>It was growing dark, but the council still argued and
disputed at a little distance from the circle entrenched,
and words were running high among its members.</p>

<p>All at once a shot was heard, and a bullet tore its
way from the gloom of the trees, crashed through Kirke's
stockade, and buried itself in the ground.</p>

<p>"Ameh!" shrieked the women, springing to the farthest
corners.</p>

<p>The men leapt from their haunches, upon which they were
crouching, and jumped over into the circle, glad enough
now of the protection afforded them by Kirke's foresight,
and once more willing to accept his gallant leadership.</p>

<p>Whiz!&mdash;ping!&mdash;went a second shot; followed by a third&mdash;a
fourth. Kirke caught up his gun, and blazed back a
return fire, aimed in the direction from which the assault
came. "But," thought he, "this is of little avail, for we
cannot take aim at the wretches, whereas the blaze of our
lamps makes us so many marks to them."</p>

<p>But the firm resistance offered had an effect; the dacoits'
shots lessened, then ceased. What did this mean? They
must have some new scheme on foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>The besieged stood in line, facing the jungle, with the
women and children behind. Suddenly, wild shrieks from
them announced danger. Two of the dacoits had crept
around, under cover of the long grass, crawling like snakes
close to the ground, and were prepared to leap into the
fence, dahs in hand.</p>

<p>With one bound, Kirke sprang to that side with clubbed
gun, and struck one man down from a swinging blow on
the head. Ralph was at his side in the same instant, with
a native spear in his hand, the first weapon which he could
catch up. One of the women, who was engaged in cooking
the supper, flung the pot of boiling rice at the intruders in
the same moment of time. It hit another fellow right in his
face, and the scalding contents ran down all his naked body,
at which he uttered a demoniacal howl of pain.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Miss Pretty!" called out Kirke. "Have at
them! There's a plucky girl."</p>

<p>Were it not for the women, who came gallantly to the
aid of the men, the fight would have been a short and hopeless
one, for the dacoits evidently had been reinforced in
numbers. They assailed the little camp on all sides,&mdash;there
was no spot from which a terrible face did not gleam and
disappear. They tore at the defences with their hands,&mdash;they
tugged at the stakes with feet and teeth,&mdash;they
hurled darts, they fired shots,&mdash;now from this side, now
from that. The villagers fought like wild animals,&mdash;both
they and the dacoits uttering fierce yells and shrieks;
only the two young Englishmen set their teeth, and silently
struggled, side by side, with their doom. One&mdash;two dacoits
more fell dead, but the rest were fiercer than ever.</p>

<p>The ammunition was exhausted, their strength failing
them, it was but desperation which enabled them to maintain
the combat, but they fought on and on.</p>

<p>Daylight broke at last; the short night was over, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the assailants retreated once more beneath the cover of the
jungle. Kirke reckoned up his men.</p>

<p>Two of them were wounded seriously, one by a cut on the
head from a dah, the other by a gun-shot in the chest. One
of the girls was thrust through the shoulder by a spear, and
a child had been killed.</p>

<p>All the powder was gone, but there were spears, dahs,
and clubs in sufficient quantity,&mdash;also food,&mdash;and there were
a good many musket balls still left.</p>

<p>Moung Shway Poh had found a shelter beneath the
thickest part of the stockade, where he was found, squatted
on his heels, under the shade of the strongest umbrella that
had been saved.</p>

<p>"You old coward!" cried Kirke. "I missed you in the
night, and wasted compassion upon you, fearing you were
wounded or killed. Have you been hiding there all this
time, while we others have been fighting for you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be rude, Englishman," said the old sinner, with
all the dignity which he could assume; "what would have
become of my people if their grandfather were hurt. It
was for their sake that I took care of myself; the royal self's
lord should think what would become of all without the
experience of my years to guide them."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" cried the irreverent Kirke. But perhaps the
ancient Burman did not understand English vernacular
language.</p>

<p>There was one missing whose disappearance caused both
the young men much concern. Little Miss Sunshine, the
pretty little village belle, the merry child of whom both had
made such a pet, was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>They searched up and down, they called, they questioned
everyone, but all fruitlessly. No one had seen her since
Ralph had helped her to escape from the blazing hut. So
imminent had been the peril, so hot the fighting, so much
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
had there been to do in the intervals, so anxious was Kirke
about Ralph, that it was not until he put the people into
a sort of review, and counted them over, that the little girl
was missed.</p>

<p>It was Ralph who thought of her then. "Where is Miss
Sunshine?" asked he.</p>

<p>No one knew, no one had seen her, no one had thought
about her. That she had fallen a victim to the dacoits in
their ambush among the jungle was the most likely fate to
have befallen her. She was gone, and had left no sign.</p>

<p>With heavy hearts Kirke and Ralph set themselves to
prepare for the inevitable renewal of the enemy's attack
when darkness once more covered their approach.</p>

<p>Kirke sharpened the spears and knives, and Ralph
caused the women to tie up musket balls at either end
of long pieces of cloth, such as they wore girded around
their loins for clothing. These made excellent weapons,
and the Burmese quickly mastered the knack of using them.</p>

<p>Rice was prepared, water-pots refilled, fuel brought in,
stones piled in heaps,&mdash;some of the people slept while others
watched. All was put into the best order possible.</p>

<p>A sorrowful event occurred in the course of the day, which
fired the English breasts with indignation.</p>

<p>One of the children in the village owned a pretty cat,
which was the beloved of her heart, and responded to the
petting which it received with all the love a cat can feel
and show.</p>

<p>The house in which this child lived was one of those
destroyed by fire, and, though the inhabitants had escaped
the intended massacre, no one had thought of the household
pet. Little Golden-leaf had sobbed herself to sleep, fretting
for its loss the night before; and her mother consoled her
by saying that pussie had gone mousing into the jungle,
and would come home when she had caught enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>About the middle of the day, a prolonged feline wail was
heard, and the little one called out, "My puss, my puss, I
hear her crying for me!"</p>

<p>In another moment the poor cat was seen limping painfully
along, leaving a track of blood along its path. Each
of her four paws was cut off, and the wretched creature was
trying to crawl back to its friends upon its stumps of legs,
with the fillet from a dacoit's head tied to its neck, to which
a sharp stone was attached. It made its tortured way through
a tiny gap in the stockade, and tried to rub itself against its
little mistress's legs in the old affectionate manner, in joy at
having found her again.</p>

<p>Little Golden-leaf burst into pitiful grief.</p>

<p>"Your father will put it out of its pain," said her mother.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" sobbed the child, "he shall not put his
soul in danger for me or my puss. The good Englishman
will cure my puss, and its little paws shall grow again.
Won't they?" cried she, turning to Ralph.</p>

<p>"No, my pretty; it would be kinder to kill poor pussie
at once," said he.</p>

<p>"No, no!" reiterated the tender-hearted little girl,&mdash;"No,
no! I cannot bear it. Make pussie well, good kind man."</p>

<p>Ralph had not the heart to distress her further. He felt
very sick as he looked at the maimed animal, and thought
what the message with which it had been sent might
mean.</p>

<p>What had been the fate of pretty Little Miss Sunshine,
when the wretches could have exercised such cruelty upon
a helpless dumb animal! He tied up the mangled legs of
the poor cat, and it tried to purr as it lay in its little friend's
arms while the operation went on. The child then carried
it to the fire, and sat down to nurse and cuddle it, while
Kirke built up a sort of rampart over and around her, to
serve as a shelter as well as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"They meant that as a hint of what they will do to any
of us if they catch us alive," said he to Ralph.</p>

<p>"They <i>must</i> catch none of us alive," replied Denham.</p>

<p>"May God help us all," sighed Kirke.</p>

<p>"In Him do I put my trust," replied Ralph firmly.</p>

<p>"If anything goes wrong with me," resumed Kirke, after
a few moments, "you will send word to my father, won't
you, Denham? and tell him I wish I had been a better son
to him, and a better man, which I would have tried to be
had I been spared."</p>

<p>"I will," said Ralph, "if I am spared myself, but there
is little chance for either of us."</p>

<p class="pmb3">"I fear not," said Kirke; and neither of them spoke more
for a long time.</p>


<p class="break" />

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />

<small>SUNSHINE'S HEROISM</small></h2>


<p>Kirke insisted upon Ralph's wound being redressed at
intervals all through that dreadful day, whatever else was
being done.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" said Ralph, with a quaint smile.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to leave a stone unturned," replied Kirke.
"Somehow, I feel as if <i>you</i> had a future before you whatever
comes to the rest of us. You have nine lives, like that poor
cat, which really seems content in the little one's lap after
all its suffering."</p>

<p>Ralph gave a short laugh, with a ring of bitterness in it.
"While there is life there is hope, you think," said he.</p>

<p>"Just so," replied Kirke.</p>

<p>Again the day wore on, and the sun sank in the west.</p>

<p>"It must soon be decided now," said Kirke. "Shake
hands, old fellow, I am glad we met here, whatever
befalls."</p>

<p>"God for the right!" exclaimed Ralph, as their hands
met. They then separated, for they had agreed each to
command at one edge of the circle, and it was time to
assume their places.</p>

<p>None too soon, either, for, directly that the dusk made
all things obscure, the attack once more began.</p>

<p>It was probable that the dacoits themselves had run short
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of powder on the previous evening, and had utilised the
day by going to their homes to fetch more, for again they
commenced by blazing away at long range.</p>

<p>But Kirke made the people crouch low, and had, through
the day, considerably strengthened his defences, so that
the firing caused few casualties for a long time. The
besieged could only have returned the attack by stone
throwing, which would have been of little use as long as the
enemy remained under cover, and at a distance, while it
would have betrayed the exhaustion of their ammunition.</p>

<p>He therefore counselled a passive endurance of the firing,
hoping by this means to lure the dacoits out of their cover
into closer quarters; and this subterfuge took effect.</p>

<p>The dusky figures crept out from behind the trees, and
advanced stealthily.</p>

<p>Kirke waited until they were within a couple of yards of
the stockade, then sprang suddenly to his feet, and
shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, my friends!"</p>

<p>A pelting shower of stones seconded his cry; the enemy's
advance was checked, the line wavered, broke, and began
to retreat, when a shot rang out from the jungle,&mdash;a fatal,
too well-directed shot, aimed at Kirke's tall commanding
figure, and he fell.</p>

<p>With a cry of dismay, Ralph sprang to the side of his
friend, but the dacoits took fresh courage, and dashed at
the defences in a body, like a dark wave pouring over a
rocky shore.</p>

<p>The flimsy barriers rocked and gave way before them,
and all were inextricably mixed up at once in a deadly hand-to-hand
warfare.</p>

<p>Ralph, standing astride the body of his friend, fought
like a madman. The ground beneath his feet grew slippery
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
with blood; one&mdash;two dacoits fell beneath the desperate
blows of his clubbed gun, over which he found that his
hands took a better purchase than over the shaft of a spear;
but his strength was deserting him, his adherents were
falling around him, his head reeled, his sight began to fail
him, and the sickness of a fainting fit nearly overpowered
him. He believed his last moment was come, when&mdash;what
sound met his ear? He must be delirious, mad&mdash;it
could not be an English cheer! It could never be the
gallop of horses' feet&mdash;many horses, tearing madly along
the forest path?</p>

<p>But again it came, nearer and nearer. "Hallo! hallo!
Hurrah! There they are!" and a party of horsemen in
white uniform dashed upon the scene.</p>

<p>The tide of battle was turned, the dacoits tried to fly;
the English police officers rode them down, shot them down,
struck them down;&mdash;no mercy was shown. The robbers
fought like demons, desperate in their turn, but all were
killed or taken prisoners in half an hour, bound, cowed,
conquered, and the fray was over.</p>

<p>The English officer came up to shake his rescued countrymen
by the hand, with frank, hearty greeting on his lip,
but Ralph had thrown himself down on the ground, his
face buried on the breast of his dead friend, choking with
sobs.</p>

<p>Mr. Brudenel, for it was he, felt a moisture arise to his
own eyes at the sight. He turned aside, and brushed his
hand across them, then knelt by Ralph's side, and laid a
kindly hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said he; "would to God that I had
been here but one hour sooner."</p>

<p>"But one hour, but one little hour," moaned the boy.
"Oh, my friend! my dear, true friend!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was the fortune of war, sir," said the officer. "It
was the will of God. Be a man, sir; your friend did not
suffer."</p>

<p>"No," said Ralph, rising, "it was all in one minute.
Oh, Kirke, Kirke! I cannot yet believe it that you are
gone."</p>

<p>He sank down again, for he could really not stand. The
excitement which had given him fictitious strength was over,
and all his powers were exhausted.</p>

<p>Brudenel signed to his men to lift and carry him to a
short distance, where they laid him down upon a mat, cast
water on his face, and poured some drops of stimulant into
his mouth.</p>

<p>Some of the Burmese women drew round and fanned
him, others brought all they had which they fancied might
be of service.</p>

<p>Leaving him to the best among these, Mr. Brudenel
turned to his other duties. The wounded must be attended
to, the dead buried, the surviving dacoits marched off to
prison.</p>

<p>Moung Shway Poh, who seemed to bear a charmed life,
for he had come out of the affray unharmed, was clamouring
a farrago of boastful explanations, servile gratitude, and
accounts of his own great bravery in defending the countrymen
of his royal lord's self. Fatigued by the clamour, of
which he believed nothing, Mr. Brudenel swore at him for
a noisy nuisance, and Mr. Grandfather turned to bestow his
eloquence upon one of the native policemen, whose politeness
was greater.</p>

<p>All was done at last, some sort of order restored, the
dead were buried, and Brudenel engaged to send assistance
to the villagers in rebuilding their houses. Two or three of
his men were left as a guard, with plenty of powder and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
shot, and the little encampment made as comfortable as
circumstances permitted for the present.</p>

<p>A hasty litter was prepared for Ralph, and carried by four
of the villagers, hired for the purpose; and the horsemen
mounted for their return journey.</p>

<p>"By the bye," said Mr. Brudenel, turning back in the
saddle as he prepared to start,&mdash;"By the bye, my wife has
taken good care of that brave child, and she shall return in
the bullock-bandy which will bring you the things I have
promised to send you, along with your friends here who
are carrying this gentleman."</p>

<p>"Child,&mdash;brave child? Who do you mean, paya?"</p>

<p>"Why, the brave little maid who came alone through the
jungle to send us to your assistance. You must make much
of her, for it was the deed of a heroine. You would not
find many, much older than she, who would have done so
brave a thing."</p>

<p>Ralph raised himself upon his elbow. "Oh!" cried he,
"was it Sunshine, the little maid whom we missed?"</p>

<p>"I did not ask her name," replied Brudenel. "She said
that the white boy had saved her life, and that of her
grandmother; and she had walked twenty miles, over mountains
and through jungle paths, to fetch us. She was quite
exhausted on her arrival, and Mrs. Brudenel kept her to rest
and recruit. You all owe your lives to her."</p>

<p>"God bless her!" murmured Ralph.</p>

<p>Yes, it was little Miss Sunshine to whom they had all
owed their rescue. She knew of what the dacoits were
capable; she was very fond of both Kirke and Ralph, who
had petted her, taught her many things, given her many
little treasures, ingeniously contrived after English fashion.</p>

<p>They had played with her, and been always courteous to
her&mdash;as gentlemen should ever be. No sooner had Ralph
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
fetched her down from the blazing hut, than she hid herself
in the jungle to watch the course of events. She saw
the repulse of the dacoits, and tracked them to their lair in
the jungle afterwards.</p>

<p>There, understanding their speech so thoroughly, she
discovered that the leader was the terrible Moung Nay
Nya, the tiger, the terrible robber who was tattooed by the
"Bandee-tha," and carried a ghastly "beloo" upon his
chest, inoculated with a preparation compounded of dead
men's flesh, which he had also chewed during the whole time
that the operation had lasted.</p>

<p>The "beloo" nature had thus entered into him, and
given him the strength and ferocity of a wild beast itself.
Sunshine had often heard of him, and shuddered, from the
place of her concealment, to observe the marks which she
had so often heard described.</p>

<p>There was the horrible demon face on the man's broad
muscular chest, with tail wound in voluminous folds around
it, and claws extended beneath. There were the square-shaped
charmed indentations which prevented bullet or
sword-thrust from injuring the tiger-man, tattooed in both
red and blue; there was a row of charmed stones let in
beneath the skin of his neck, each of which endowed him
with some wizard power or ensured him safety in combats.</p>

<p>She noticed the long lean arms, the powerful hands, the
muscular body, the sunken cheeks and cruel determined
mouth, and trembled in every limb to think of his seizing
her. She softly slipped farther and farther back under
the shadow of the trees, and thought.</p>

<p>Did this terrible tiger-man succeed in capturing her
dear English boy, what tortures might he not inflict upon
him were the ransom which he would certainly demand
not paid! She could not bear to think of it. The tales
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
which she had been told might have been exaggerated,
but many of them were too true, nor did the appearance
of the man belie them. Sunshine believed them all.</p>

<p>While she hesitated, uncertain what to do, little Golden-leaf's
pet cat came crying up to her, telling, in its own
fashion, its story of fright and trouble, and glad to meet
with a well-known friend. But, fearful lest the little
creature should betray her whereabouts to the dacoits,
she turned and fled, followed for a little way by the cat,
but soon beyond the boundaries familiar to it, and it turned
back to meet with the cruelty which the girl escaped.</p>

<p>She ran and ran till she was tired, then sat down to rest,
and cry. All at once, a resolution entered her mind. She
would make her way to the police-station, where she would
be safe, and whence aid for her friends would certainly be
sent to them.</p>

<p>She wished that she had thought of it before. The day
was bright now, she knew in which direction the station
lay, but she did not know how far off it was.</p>

<p>Bravely did she set out, walking on, on, on; climbing
steep hills, wading through marshy places, cutting her
bare feet with stones,&mdash;hungry, tired, and disheartened, but
persistent. She had to rest many times, and the day wore
away and night fell.</p>

<p>She struggled on to a pagoda which she saw on the side
of a hill, and where she thought that she would pass the dark
hours safely. She did not expect to find shelter there, for
she knew that these erections were solid blocks of bricks,
not buildings with chambers and apartments in which
people lived. This one was deserted and ruinous. It had
been a pious work to build it, but, the original founder
having long been dead, it was not the business of anyone
else to repair it as it became dilapidated under the influence
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of wind and weather. The piety which might have induced
such a proceeding would not be counted to the score of
the man who repaired, but to that of the first builder, in
the other world.</p>

<p>"Let everyone take care of himself," the Burman says,
and leaves his father's good deeds to fall into decay, while
he ensures his own salvation by putting up another showy
building.</p>

<p>Sunshine made her way to this place, holy in her simple
eyes; and there, climbing up a pile of fallen bricks, found
a fairly comfortable and sheltered seat, where she crouched
all night long.</p>

<p>At first she clasped her arms around her knees, and
looked out upon the dim landscape, the winding stream
shining in the valley beneath her, the brilliant stars in
the deep blue sky above,&mdash;seeing nothing of the beauty of
nature, but deeply impressed by its mystery, gazing straight
before her with wide-open eyes of awe and distrust. But
gradually fatigue overpowered her, and, leaning her head
back against the stones, she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Her sleep lasted long, and she woke when the sun was
already high; arising stiff, hungry, and thirsty, to another
toiling journey. First she would go down to the stream
and drink. As she stooped, she saw a troop of horsemen
cantering along the farther bank, taking their morning
exercise. She knew the British dress&mdash;these were the
people whom she was seeking; she stumbled through the
stream, limped up to Mr. Brudenel, and implored him to
ride fast to the rescue of her friends.</p>

<p>"Oh, paya! paya!" she cried, "the dacoits burn our
village, they murder all,&mdash;ride quickly and save my father.
There are Englishmen there, they will murder them too,&mdash;ride
fast, fast to save them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">Mr. Brudenel put quick questions to her; eliminated the
chief features of the case; ordered one of the men to take
the poor weary girl up to the station, and ask Mrs. Brudenel
to look after her; galloped back for arms and reinforcements;
and, on fresh horses, headed his troop for the rapid
ride to the scene of action; arriving, as we have seen, when
the besieged had come to their last gasp, and not in time to
save all.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>Mr. Brudenel, as has been said, met Sunshine while on his
morning ride, and returned in desperate haste to gather up
his men, and the ammunition, etc., necessary for the skirmish
which he knew was in store for them.</p>

<p>He met his wife, who, perceiving that some unusual event
had happened, came anxiously to meet him.</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear?" asked she.</p>

<p>"Don't delay me, wifey," said he in violent hurry. "A
girl has brought in an account of a daring outbreak of
dacoity. From her story I hope to catch the fellow I have
been looking out for this long time. Don't be frightened
if I don't come home to-night, the place is some way off,
and there will be a scrimmage; but all will go well, I
hope."</p>

<p>"A scrimmage!" exclaimed Mrs. Brudenel in terror.
"Oh, Harry!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a little goose, my dear; such things must come
sometimes. There, kiss me,&mdash;don't worry yourself, good-bye.
Take care of the girl till I come back," shouted he at the
last moment, mounting his pony, and calling back over his
shoulder, preparing to follow his men out of the compound.</p>

<p>He was gone, and his wife's eyes were so full of tears
that she could not see him to the very last. The clatter of
the ponies' feet faded away, and she re-entered the house.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Mr. Gilchrist, who had been taking an early ramble, met her.
"What is all the excitement about?" asked he.</p>

<p>"I hardly know," replied she; "some Burmese girl has
brought news of dacoits, and Harry has gone to see about
it. He expects to fight, and I am so frightened."</p>

<p>The tears gathered again, and rolled down her white
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Don't alarm yourself, my dear young lady," said Mr.
Gilchrist kindly. "Your husband has gone through such
things a dozen times before safely, and we will hope that all
will be right again. Where is the girl? Shall I talk to her
and find out all about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I would be <i>so</i> much obliged if you would! I
cannot understand half that the people say yet."</p>

<p>Sunshine was in the cook's house, being fed and comforted
by the servants. Mr. Gilchrist began to talk to her,
and had not exchanged many sentences before his interest
deepened into great excitement.</p>

<p>"Osborn!&mdash;Wills!" he cried, "come here and listen.
This girl says that there are young Englishmen in the
village, is it possible that one could be our dear Ralph?
What did you say they are called, my dear?"</p>

<p>But the soft nature of the Burmese language utterly refused
to accommodate itself to the harsh sounds of our
friends' names. "Ralph" had always been pronounced
"Yabé," and "Kirke" had been quite unmanageable, so he
had proposed being called "Jamie," which was rendered
"Yamie."</p>

<p>"Yabé" and "Yamie" puzzled Mr. Gilchrist, who did not
know that Kirke was christened James. "What are the
Englishmen like, girl?"</p>

<p>"Yamie is big, oh, so big!" said she. "He is good, but
his eyes do not laugh like those of Yabé. They have dark
fire in them, and he has hair all round," passing her hand
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
about the lower part of her face. "It is like the jungle
bushes."</p>

<p>"What colour?" asked Wills.</p>

<p>"Like yours," said she.</p>

<p>Wills was black-haired and grizzled. His face fell. "He
is old, then?" asked he.</p>

<p>"No, young," replied Sunshine. "Young as a father."</p>

<p>"It cannot be Ralph," said he.</p>

<p>"That is what he calls the other," said Sunshine; "Yabé,
that is what he calls him. Moung Yabé, Moung Shway
Yabé, I say, for he is good, oh, so good! He came for me
when the <i>thok'kee</i> blazed, and all was on fire; he saved
me, and took Me Poh on his back, and saved her from those
beloos of thieves, and from the hot fire. Oh, Moung Yabé
is strong and good, as gold&mdash;fine gold. My dear Moung
Shway Paya Yabé."</p>

<p>"Is he like me, too?" asked old Wills.</p>

<p>Sunshine laughed out all over her face, her eyes danced
with merriment. "Oh, no, no, no!" she cried. "Moung
Yabé young, Moung Yabé beautiful! He laugh like Sunshine;
he gay, he play with little Sunshine, throw roses at her, run
after her&mdash;dance, sing. All the girls love Moung Yabé, my
Moung Shway Yabé! Oh," she resumed, breaking down
all at once into sorrow, "if the good soldiers are only in time
to save my Moung Yabé from those beloos!"</p>

<p>The men looked at each other. "Can it be Ralph?" they
asked, hope dawning upon each in turn.</p>

<p>"Is <i>his</i> hair like the jungle bushes?" inquired Gilchrist.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Sunshine, cheering up again. "Moung
Yabé is Shway Yabé, golden boy, white as the lady, no hair
here," again passing her hand over her face.</p>

<p>Sudden inspiration seized upon Osborn, "Does he sing
like this?" asked he, beginning Ralph's well-known "I'll
bang my harp on a willow tree."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Sunshine laughed outright. "That is my Moung Yabé's
music," said she; and, making it into a literal song without
words, she finished the air with great glee.</p>

<p>"My God!&mdash;my God is merciful!" ejaculated Mr.
Gilchrist. "Osborn, my pony; quick, quick!"</p>

<p>"Oh! are you going to help Mr. Brudenel?" asked his
wife. "How good of you! You will keep him safe, won't
you, and bring him back unhurt?"</p>

<p>"Tell her, Wills!" shouted Mr. Gilchrist, forgetting his
manners utterly as he rushed out to the stable.</p>

<p>Osborn was as excited as he; they snatched down their
saddles, had them upon their ponies in three minutes, and
were tearing out of the compound before Mrs. Brudenel
comprehended anything of the matter.</p>

<p>Wills, indeed, forgot her interest, and the danger to her
husband, in his wistful longing to accompany them. "I
wish, I do wish I could ha' gone too," sighed he; but there
was not a beast left in the stable now, all had gone, and
only the servants of the house remained.</p>

<p>By degrees the lady's questions recalled him to the
present, and he told her all. There was much mystery
about Sunshine's story even now. Who the Englishman
was who had so much gold, and who had arrived in the
village alone, and been so ill there, was a great puzzle.
Sunshine said that he knew Moung Yabé, they were
brothers,&mdash;"Dohs,"&mdash;whether "thway-thouks" or blood-drinkers
she did not know.</p>

<p>She here alluded to a peculiar custom among the
Burmans, of two friends swearing to be brothers to each
other, and in some cases cementing the alliance by drinking
water mixed with drops of blood taken from each
others' arms.</p>

<p>Yabé, Sunshine said, had come across the river, naked,
and had nothing with him but a little packet of plants
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
which must have been charmed, and protected him from
wild beasts in the jungle. He could not have come naked
through the wild jungle unless the "nats" had taken care
of him. Where he came from Sunshine did not know.
Yamie had paid her mother for making clothes for him
such as he wore himself; made from native cloth, but not
"putsoes."</p>

<p>The plants seemed to point yet more directly to the stranger
being identical with Denham, but who could "Yamie" be?
And how did Denham arrive there, and in such a condition?</p>

<p>But Mrs. Brudenel was sure that it must be Ralph. She
set herself to make every possible preparation, and the
occupation helped her to pass that anxious day.</p>

<p>Sunshine, as soon as she had told all she knew, being
well fed and made comfortable, fell sound asleep on a mat
in the verandah, and rested from her fatigues.</p>

<p>Hour passed after hour, and none of the men returned.
Mrs. Brudenel became sick with apprehension, nor was old
Wills much better. Neither of them retired to rest that
night, for they hoped that some of the party would return
every moment. They sat together, each trying to keep up
a brave face before the other, but neither of them much
deceived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brudenel went to her room, ever and anon, and sank
on her knees to pray for the beloved of her heart. Then
she brought her Bible, and read aloud to the old seaman
soothing words of promise. It helped them both more
than anything else could have done.</p>

<p>With the earliest dawn breakfast was prepared, but no
one came to partake of it. The butler cleared it away, and
laid tiffin, but no one could touch it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brudenel's ayah, who was much attached to her
kind young mistress, brought a glass of claret and a biscuit
to her, and begged her to take it so earnestly that she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
would not refuse, and she persuaded Wills to have the
same.</p>

<p>Then the long waiting recommenced, and then a restless
pacing of the verandah, the walks in the compound, the
house itself. They could settle to nothing.</p>

<p>At last a servant ran up to the drawing-room window,
when Mrs. Brudenel's eyes were bent down upon her Bible,
and, for the twentieth time, she was trying to calm her
beating pulses with the words, "Let not your heart be
troubled."</p>

<p>"They come, lady! They come, missie! Master is
come!"</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet. Yes, there was Mr. Brudenel at
the head of his men, crossing the ford in the valley beneath
her feet. There was Mr. Gilchrist, waving his hat frantically.
There was Osborn, hand to mouth, evidently yelling out
"Hooray!" at the top of his voice, though still too far off
to be heard.</p>

<p>And who else? Behind Mr. Gilchrist appeared a slim,
fair-haired lad, in a loose dress of dark native cloth and a
wide palm-leaf hat. He lifted his head at Osborn's wild
gestures, and waved his hat to Wills.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, I thank Thee, I humbly thank Thee!"
ejaculated the old man fervently.</p>

<p>The servants almost tumbled over each other in their
excited haste to see, to prepare, to welcome. Mrs.
Brudenel and old Wills shook hands, with streaming eyes,
under the relief from the intense strain upon their spirits
through so many hours.</p>

<p>The troop entered the compound, and was surrounded by
the eager household.</p>

<p>"We have him, Wills," was heard in Mr. Gilchrist's glad
voice.</p>

<p>"My Yabé! My Moung Shway boy!" cried Sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Harry! Harry!" sobbed Mrs. Brudenel, clinging
to him.</p>

<p>"My boy, my boy! My dear young master!" exclaimed
old Wills.</p>

<p>"Where are the dacoits' heads?" asked the men-servants.</p>

<p>"Was anyone hurt?" asked the ayah, mother to one of
the men.</p>

<p>All spoke at once, no one answered anybody else. Ralph
nearly wrung Wills' hands off; Osborn thumped him on
the back, and slapped his own thighs with triumphant joy;
while Mr. Gilchrist's face, as he presented Ralph to Mrs.
Brudenel, with his hand upon the lad's shoulder, was good
to see.</p>

<p>There were fervent thanksgivings in that house before the
inmates retired, but there was little explanation of all which
had occurred until, after a quiet night's rest, they all reassembled
in the early morning. Then Ralph, in a simple,
straightforward manner, recounted his adventures,&mdash;told of
Kirke's repentance, his goodness to himself, his bravery,
and his gallant defence of the village.</p>

<p>"Oh, how well he redeemed the past!" mourned he.
"What a fine fellow he was after all, and he has gone
without anyone knowing of what he did! I loved him,&mdash;he
earned the love of all, and the respect too."</p>

<p>The dacoits had been sent to Rangoon for trial, and were
all hanged eventually, many crimes being traced to their
score.</p>

<p>Ralph's adventures were now at an end; Mr. Gilchrist
gave up his wanderings, and went down to Rangoon
with him, under the escort of Mr. Brudenel, when that
gentleman went to give evidence against the tiger dacoit.
He went the more willingly inasmuch as Ralph's little
orchids proved to be of a hitherto unknown species, and
very valuable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>Sunshine, plentifully rewarded, was restored safely to her
friends, and all the houses were rebuilt better and stronger
than before.</p>

<p>Great treasures of English manufacture reached the place
from time to time; for Ralph never forgot the children with
whom he had played, the women who had tended him,
the men who had fought by his side, or the grave of him
who had been his worst enemy and his greatest friend.</p>

<p>To that man's father he wrote, making light of his
failings, but detailing his gallantry at every point.</p>

<p>In course of time he received an answer, which ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for the comfort which you have given
me regarding my dear son. Your letter, with his confession,
and attempt to redeem his past, are an old man's greatest
treasures, and shall lie on his breast when life shall be no
more."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ralph rose to wealth and repute in Rangoon, and was
always a comfort to his mother, the joy of her heart.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mr. Gilchrist became a great scientific botanist, and
published many a volume upon the jungles of Burma.</p>

<h2><a id="JULES_VERNE">JULES VERNE</a></h2>


<p>The romantic old French town of Nantes, near the estuary of
the Loire, and only thirty-five miles away from the sea, has the
honour of having been the birthplace of Jules Verne, the author
of bewitching stories that have now fascinated three generations
of girls and boys.</p>

<p>Jules Verne was many years before he found where his
strength lay. He was educated at Nantes, and then he went
to Paris to study law. Next he began to write plays and
comedies, some of which reached the stage; and it was not
until the year 1863, when he was thirty-five years of age, that
he went to a publisher in Paris, with a story entitled, <i>Five
Weeks in a Balloon</i>, and so began that very long list of books
by which he has become famous.</p>

<p>Jules Verne delighted to live in <i>Le Saint Michel</i>, a small
yacht of eight or ten tons, in which was a large chest that contained
the boat's library. On board this yacht Jules Verne
thought out some of his wonderful romances. Usually his
trips were from Crotoy to Harve; but at times he took in
more provisions and fared forth to the coasts of Normandy,
Brittany, and even of England.</p>

<p>Each reader will decide for himself which of Jules Verne's
captivating stories he likes best; but the critics mention
<i>Dropped from the Clouds</i> and <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i>
as the books which stand apart from the others. Some of our
most attractive stories are about islands: <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and
Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>Treasure Island</i>, and Verne's <i>The
Mysterious Island</i> is fit to rank with these. Under this one
title we have a group of three separate volumes. First comes
<i>Dropped from the Clouds</i>, then <i>Abandoned</i>, and the whole narrative
is completed by <i>The Secret of the Island</i>. The boy who
embarks upon the reading of these three books has a long
period of excitement and delight stretching in front of him.
The very numerous pictures, too, in these three memorable
volumes are very arresting.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Jules Verne died on March 24, 1905, at Amiens when he was
seventy-seven years of age, and he left a long list of books.</p>
